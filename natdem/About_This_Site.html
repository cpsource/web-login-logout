<br>
This web site is dedicated toward helping America define and
refine policy and platforms.<br>
<br>
It's unfortunate, but the Democratic Party has lost site of its roots
by trying to be more '<span style="font-style: italic;">Republican</span>'
than the Republicans.<br>
<br>
So, to get things back on track, this site focuses on
Progressive Platforms for Working Americans.<br>
<br>
It can be simply stated that this site represents the '<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Democratic Wing</span>' of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Democratic Party</span>.<br>
<br>
Progressive Platforms are not anti-business. Take for example, the
issue of health care. Businesses are being burdened with ever rising
costs, while at the same time, we have 41 million uninsured Americans.
So, what's a solution that's mutually beneficial to both parties? One
solution would reduce the costs to businesses, as well as provide at
least some coverage for the uninsured. There is such a solution,
and we propose it <a

in our web site.<br>
