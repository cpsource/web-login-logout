<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">OUR GENES: THE&nbsp; PROBLEM,&nbsp;
THE SOLUTION,&nbsp; AND&nbsp;
THE&nbsp; OPPORTUNITY</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Fall of
2000, I asked one of my grandsons to build a 2 foot high model of the
double
helix, the human genome.&nbsp; (Ridley 1999)&nbsp; I brought it down
from
northern Vermont to Lexington, Massachusetts, and set it on top of a
grand
piano in the meeting hall of First <br>
Parish Church.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="/rights/book/17-layer-dna-model-sm.jpg" title=""
 alt="Double Helix" style="width: 150px; height: 345px;"><br>
</p>
<p>The Double Helix<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said to the
people who gathered around it: "The chemicals which make up the human
genome
are controlling your feelings and behavior. They control our human
nature.&nbsp;
They are the same chemicals that were controlling the people who
founded
this church and started the American Revolution on the morning of April
19, 1775."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a copy
of this book in my hand and continued. "This book is about the start of
another revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is about how to use these chemicals
to reach the freedom that comes with knowing how they function. It's
about
how to be conscious of how these chemicals are now controlling you and
me and everybody else.&nbsp; It's about how to decide how you want
these
chemicals to be controlling you.&nbsp; And it's about how to help and
lead
in bringing about increases in effectiveness of democracy by taking
control
of how these chemicals control us.&nbsp; It's about practical ways that
my colleagues and I have found in actual tests of natural democracy and
governance that proved to us it will work"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chemicals
of the double helix are the genes. The assemblage of them into all of
the
double helixes in all the cells of our body is called the genome.&nbsp;
Our human genome controls our feelings and behavior.&nbsp; Now we know
enough about how it works so that we can take control of
ourselves.&nbsp;
The revolution this knowledge allows is that we can now decide what
feelings
and behaviors we want our genes to induce. This will give us a really
true
freedom.&nbsp; We are not proposing to change human nature; rather we
propose
to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; co-opt it.&nbsp; Using the new knowledge, we
can make progress toward great goals that have been elusive heretofore.
They include the achievement of peace and happiness for all
humankind.&nbsp;
These goals have evaded us because we haven't understood until quite
recently
how our genes work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can improve
our democracy by taking our genes into account.&nbsp; I put my life on
the line in World War II.&nbsp; I did it as many veterans did -- to
preserve
democracy.&nbsp; We had to kill in order to do it.&nbsp; Without
realizing
it, I was under the control of these genes when I did this
killing.&nbsp;
We veterans of that war have often cried out "Never again!&nbsp; The
world
doesn't need to be doing this to itself."&nbsp;&nbsp; With more
accurate
understanding of our genes that cry can become a reality.&nbsp; We can
clean up the mess caused by automatic control of us by our genes: such
as war; crime; violence; and all the suffering of children. The
understanding
of the new freedom to be in control of our genes opens up the
possibility
of becoming all that we and our children can be.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To articulate
the challenge: can we, all humanity, develop a form of governance that
helps us to achieve this new form of self control?&nbsp; Can we create
a natural governance and natural democracy, with the potential for
helping
us achieve better lives for ourselves and each other?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In February of
2001, the world was given a window on our genes, on humanity's
genome.&nbsp;
(Nature, February 15, 2001 and Science , February 16, 2001)&nbsp;
Through
that window, scientists have looked at the genetic structure that has
led
to humanity's current overbearing domination of the earth. (Ref: Svante
Paabo, Genomics and Society: the Human Genome and Our View of
Ourselves).&nbsp;
The view changes the way we think about ourselves and who we are.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These parts of
the genome are lined up in long chains called chromosomes. The chemical
line-up within each chromosome is called the human genome sequence.and
is sometimes referred to as DNA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many parts of
each
chain have an influence not only on how we develop, or to which
diseases
we are susceptible, but on the very ways we behave and how we
feel.&nbsp;
The genes influence our feelings and behavior under certain
conditions.&nbsp;
They do this by programming the chromosomes to make copies of
themselves
(actually making a copy of one of the two strands of the double
helix)&nbsp;
These copies make proteins which in turn instruct the chemical
reactions
in various parts of our body, including our muscles and nerves.&nbsp;
Muscles,
nerves, and other parts are at one end of this serial process which
controls
the ways we feel and behave. Care has to be exercised in using the word
control. Human behavior is not solely genetically determined.&nbsp; Our
physical and social environments have strong influences on feelings and
behaviors.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humans are much
more than simply the product of a genome, but in a sense we are, both
collectively
and individually, defined within the genome.&nbsp; The mapping,
sequencing
and analysis of the human genome is a fundamental advance in
self-knowledge.
(Dennis, Carina, Richard Gallagher, and Philip Campbell, Everyone's
Genome,
Nature, February 15, 2001).&nbsp; With the completion of the human
genome
sequence, we have received a powerful tool for unlocking the secrets of
our genetic heritage and for finding our place among the other
participants
in the adventure of life.&nbsp; (Ref: Barbara Jasny and Donald Kennedy,
The Human Genome, Science, February 16, 2001)
</p>
<p>MY JOURNEY
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this priceless
tool, this gift to humanity, can we discover how to put it to work for
us?&nbsp; Even before the recent scientific breakthroughs, I had that
challenge
on my mind. I came back from World War II with the feeling that I had
been
lucky to have lived through it.&nbsp; I felt that whatever happened
next
would be grace; I could use my time for anything. What did I want to do
with my life?&nbsp; I started a search into what do we humans want to
do
with life?&nbsp; My instinct said that once we know the answers to
those
questions individually and together we'll find ways to get along better
in the world.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My father had
died of tuberculosis when I was six.&nbsp; Two years later a cure was
found
for that disease.&nbsp; I wondered if there can be a cure for war.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To develop this
thinking, I decided to learn more about human nature.&nbsp; What is
there
about our nature that is keeping us, humanity, from reaching our full
potential,
from reaching great goals?&nbsp; One obvious example is our instinct to
kill.&nbsp; What hadn't been obvious to me until recently is what to do
about that instinct.&nbsp; In the study of the genome, there are hints
showing up about causes of aggression. (McGuffin, Peter,&nbsp; Brien
Riley,
and Robert Plomin, Genomics and Behavior: Toward Behavioral
Genomics&nbsp;&nbsp;
Science, Feb. 15, 2001)&nbsp;&nbsp; But, for now, the most productive
route
appears to be suppression of the instinct through natural democracy,
which
combines evolutionary traits with design of governance processes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose we were
to say that one thing we want to do with life is to reach great goals
--
such as becoming all we can possibly be and helping our children become
all they can possibly be. What is getting in the way of achieving such
great goals?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My instinct may
turn out to be right. In the light of the new information about our
evolutionary
history, we can understand much of the history of life in the
past.&nbsp;
Perhaps we can refine the question to: "What do we want to do with life
as it continues to be influenced by our genome?"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I've come
to realize is that we, all of us in the world, have the option of
moving
from being controlled by our human nature to being in control of our
human
nature, if we understand that nature.&nbsp; When I killed all those
people
I was being controlled by human nature.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the research
that is opening up the option of being in control of our human nature
has
been going on only within the last fifty or so years.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,
Burnham and Phelan in Mean Genes open up the option for each of us to
take
control of our human nature.&nbsp; Burnham and Phelan point out that
our
minds come with no explicit operating instructions for us to use.&nbsp;
The structures of our minds are designed and operated by our genes.
These
authors are right that genetic operation gets us into trouble a lot of
the time.&nbsp; We need to give our minds explicit operating
instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do this by
taking over the implicit operating instructions of our genes.&nbsp; We
have the option of moving from automatic pilot by our genes to self
piloting,
giving explicit instructions to our genes.&nbsp; We can do this by
deciding
which genes, which epigenetic rules, we want to put into operation to
control
our behavior and emotions at any given time.&nbsp; Burnham and Phalen
give
examples of behavior and emotions that allow us to lose weight, put
money
in the bank, or mend neglected relationships.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book you
are reading now shows how to take that hard won understanding of human
nature into account by using it to be conscious of that nature as we
govern
ourselves. Appropriate names for this form of governance would seem to
be natural democracy or natural governance.&nbsp; Governance which
comes
naturally to us because we design it to elicit the better parts of our
human nature. Democracy is a government in which the power is vested in
the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a
system
of representation involving periodic, free elections.&nbsp; Democracy
puts
people in control.&nbsp; It provides the opportunity for Natural
Democracy
if we decide together we want it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basis for
natural democracy and natural governance is reciprocal altruism defined
as mutually beneficial exchange relationships or transactions.
(Trivers,
R. L. (1971). The evolution of reciprocal altruism, like all epigenetic
rules, occurred because of its utility. (Quarterly Review of Biology,
46,35-57).&nbsp;
Even though Trivers intended the definition to apply to non-kin, there
are times when it has utility in kin relationships as well. (For
example,
when George W. Bush signs certain types of legislation, his father
benefits
also.)&nbsp; When referring to reciprocal altruism, I will use the
shorter
term, reciprocity throughout this book.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My colleagues
and I have tested the conditions under which governance and democracy
function
to mutual advantage&nbsp;&nbsp; We have tested natural governance at
several
levels: governance within the family; governance within the community;
governance within the state and the nation; and lastly, governance in
the
world.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've tested the techniques of natural governance,
the tools by which natural governance
is fostered.&nbsp; We begin with a basic understanding
of&nbsp; human nature, the natural way we behave and
feel, and an understanding of the way humanity's
<br>
genes, our genes, control how we all behave and
feel.&nbsp; We take both these understandings into account by making
these ways visible as we think
about natural governance.&nbsp; We bring them into our
consciousness in understanding the forces that
interact
with a particular problem or issue.&nbsp; The
next tool we use is the description of the
conditions, deciding on the characteristics of the
environment which influence the issue.&nbsp; We then choose the
characteristics
that will induce natural governance to happen. For example, a powerful
characteristic is reciprocity, so we build in frequent opportunities
for
the participants in natural governance to exchange favors.&nbsp; The
fourth
tool is the process by which people interact to govern themselves,
which
defines natural democracy. Town meetings in New England are examples of
an incipient form of natural democracy.&nbsp; The fifth tool is the
choosing
of great goals which are defined by people as they participate in the
natural
democracy process. Progress toward these goals provides the incentive
for
participating.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These tools
are
the steps in the process of discovering natural democracy. Chapter 2
provides
more information on our experience with these techniques of governance.
