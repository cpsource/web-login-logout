<span style="font-weight: bold;">TOWARD&nbsp; GLOBAL&nbsp;
NATURAL&nbsp; DEMOCRACY
</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implementing
natural democracy is the most important challenge facing humanity in
the
21st Century.&nbsp; To meet the challenge we must first understand the
evolution-based characteristics of human nature, and then consciously
apply
that understanding in all the ways that people relate to each other in
the broad political processes of natural governance.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The horrors
of
W.W.II precipitated the formation of the United Nations.&nbsp; The
yearning
that I felt for better ways for people to get along together was
universal.&nbsp;
This yearning inspired the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which
was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1947 (Ref: Glendon, Mary Ann
(2001) A World Made New; Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal
Declaration
of Human Rights&nbsp; Random House. This reference will be moved&nbsp;
to the "Notes" section at the back of the book.).&nbsp; This
declaration
provides a legal and moral beacon for the world toward which natural
democracy
must steer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Universal
Declaration specifies that these rights will become available:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everyone has the right to life and liberty.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everyone has the right to the free development of his or her
personality.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Everyone has the right to education.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Education shall be directed to the full development of the human
personality.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Declaration
also provides these goals as beacons:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Freedom from fear and want
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Equal rights of men and women
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A standard of living adequate for health and well-being
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This century
will see an inevitable movement from auto-pilot to self-pilot as people
take better charge of their destiny, and work cooperatively toward
achievable
goals which they set.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last sections
of
Chapter 6 formed a vision of feasible natural democracy using the
results
of the tests reported in the previous chapters.&nbsp; If we were to
articulate
that vision, and implement natural democracy, what choices would people
be likely to want to make for their lives?&nbsp; What goals would
emerge?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">PERSONAL CHOICES
THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the
course
of the experiments described in this book, I have asked many people
with
a variety of life histories and backgrounds, "What choices would you
like
to be able to make that you can't make now?"&nbsp; Their lists were
lengthy,
but in almost every instance, their top seven choices in the order of
importance
were:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Developing
into all I'm capable of being&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Achieving
high and joyous levels of creativity and intelligence&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Having
personal control over my destiny&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Having
adequate systems for resolving human conflict&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Having
a longer productive life&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Having
mental and physical health&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Having
highly effective ways by which I can share whatever is on my mind
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I asked
the question to include their families:&nbsp; "What do you want the
future
to be for you and your family?"&nbsp; Here are their answers:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Our
children and their children will grow into all they are capable of
being.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We'll
be the ones to say what happens to us and our children.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We'll
avoid "Big Brother" and a planned, regimented society.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We'll
be doing the things that give us pleasure.&nbsp; At the same time,
we'll be making very important contributions to society and we'll feel
good about that.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>We'll
achieve high and joyous levels of creativity, exaltation from
discovery, enthusiasm, triumph, self-esteem, meaningfulness, love and
belonging; we'll help our children to achieve the same.&nbsp; We and
they will have much greater educational opportunities as well as
opportunities for second and third careers.
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">MEASUREMENTS OF PROGRESS
</span><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the opportunity
to participate in The First Global Conference on the Future, held in
Toronto,
Canada in July, 1980.&nbsp; Over 6000 people from 54 countries attended
a week long series of meetings.&nbsp; Many were actively experimenting
with ways to help people get along better in the world.&nbsp; As I
listened
to their progress, I asked myself, "If these people keep working on
what
they are doing, where will it lead?&nbsp; What goals are they working
toward?"&nbsp;
Here are my answers:
<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Humanity
develops into all it is capable of being&nbsp;</li>
  <li>There
is broad worldwide participation in decision making on goals and
priorities of
the human race&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Institutions
exist which permit everyone to work cooperatively and synergistically
toward great goals and institutions which help all people to have
personal control
of their destiny.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>All information
is available instantly to every human being on earth, on demand as
desired;
world-wide communication is completely ubiquitous; everyone has the
choice of being
highly educated; rapid and effective perception of
complex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
interrelationships
is achieved.</li>
  <li>A healthy
world; everyone has an opportunity&nbsp; to live a vigorous physical
and mental life.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My boss at
the
time was Bill McCune at Polaroid who called these goals "excessively
presumptuous."&nbsp;&nbsp;
Perhaps they were then.&nbsp; But as I re-read&nbsp; Goal 4, I realize
so much has happened over the last two decades to bring us closer to
achieving
it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A WORLD PARLIAMENT</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A proposal
for
a World Parliament has been developed and endorsed by 141 distinguished
individuals from 31 countries and every continent, including
E.O.Wilson,
Sir Arthur C. Clarke, and Paul Kurtz.&nbsp; They propose a Parliament
which
would proportionally represent the people of the world rather than
their
governments.&nbsp; It would be one house of a bicameral legislature.
The
present United Nations would continue to represent nations and serve as
the other house.&nbsp; The arrangement would be similar to the
structure
that emerged after the American Revolution when the confederation of
sovereign
states created the current federal system with a Senate and a House of
Representatives.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The test of
natural
governance in Chapter 6 showed that at the community level we can
address
local, state, national and global issues.&nbsp; The World Parliament of
Wilson and his colleagues has similarities to the community test in
Lexington
in 1975.&nbsp; We could expand the power of the World Parliament, by
allowing
communities at the Lexington level all over the world to have a say in
state, national, and global issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; In effect, this
proposal
would apply self-piloting and conscious use of the tools of natural
governance
on a&nbsp; world scale.&nbsp; These thoughts startled me.&nbsp; Were
they
realistic?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned
again to The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&nbsp; The
declaration&nbsp;
proposes a set of principles and functions which could well serve the
framework
of a World Parliament:
</p>
<p>Promote the development of friendly relations between nations.
<br>
All are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of
the law.
<br>
Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
<br>
The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of
government.
<br>
Elections shall be by universal and equal suffrage.
<br>
Everyone has the right to share in scientific advancement and its
benefits.
<br>
Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the
rights and freedoms
<br>
set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WORLD PARLIAMENT OPERATING IN A
NATURAL GOVERNANCE MODE</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tests described
in the previous chapters provide experience that is helpful&nbsp; in
describing
how the World Parliament would operate in a natural governance mode.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It could be
designed
to meet most, if not all, of the same specifications as those for
natural
governance at nation, state, and community levels.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
binding
commonality is human nature in all of its manifestations:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reciprocity
present on all issues&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Conditions
that induce reciprocity present&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Self-piloting
by leaders moving toward self-piloting by all&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Taking human
nature into account&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Deception
prevented by reciprocity&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Proceeding
toward great goals
  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as these
specifications could be implemented, so there could be a similarity in
techniques to accomplish that.&nbsp; Here is a list of appropriate
techniques
based on the experience of the tests discussed in Chapters 2 through 6.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>World Parliament staff in face to face dialogue and internet
exchange
with anyone in the world. In the Lexington
test, the staff members of the Advisory Board and the sub-committees
were
in face to face dialogue with not only the people of the Advisory Board
and the sub-committees, but also with many people all over town.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive agenda including long range goals. In the Lexington
test, the agenda was comprehensive and included long range goals.</li>
  <li>Pertinent information instantly available face to face and by
internet. Lexington test:
the Advisory Board and the sub-committees had gathered information and
made it available to all participants in the debates prior to the
voting.
To a limited extent, resource people from state and federal governments
were present to provide pertinent information as requested.</li>
  <li>The World Parliament staff members participating in reciprocal
exchanges
with people in community, state, and national governance through the
internet
and directly through a World Parliament representative as described in
Technique 7 below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lexington
test:
Prior to, during, and following the town meeting sessions, the
Lexington
town meeting staff worked reciprocally with people in the community,
the
state agencies and, to some extent, the national government to
influence
policy development at each of these levels. The policies were mutually
advantageous, such as increased funding for research on increasing
healthy
longevity. Each community would have a website to facilitate
cooperation
on such issues.</li>
  <li>All the tools of natural governance are in use in the World
Parliament.Lexington test:
Chapter 5 showed how the epigenetic rules were applied, and how the
process
at the town meetings was designed to induce reciprocity. Testing
natural
governance on crime (Chapter 3) showed how to heal breaches in
reciprocity
identified as crimes.&nbsp; The healing opened the way for new
reciprocal
exchanges.</li>
  <li>All participants are educated in an adequate understanding of
human
nature. Lexington test:
Only the staff was educated in this understanding.&nbsp; But since the
staff guided the design of the meetings, the understandings described
in
Chapters 1 and 2 and in the Appendix were put to use. Worklife and
Education test (Chapter 4): Technology was used to help educate young
people
about reciprocity.</li>
  <li>World Parliament representatives are present in community
governance
providing staff help.&nbsp; This person would be participating in
community
meetings (town meeting equivalents) in two roles.&nbsp; The first role
would be as a member of the community taking community concerns into
account.&nbsp;
The second role would be as a representative of the World Parliament in
constant communication with the parliament staff member as described in
Technique 4 above. A community web site, as mentioned in 4 above, would
facilitate such communication. Lexington was able to go only part way
in
the use of this Technique 7, primarily because the parts of natural
democracy
at the state level and beyond were only in nascent form.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights also contains insights about techniques
which
should be taken into account for an effective World Parliament: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Everyone has the right to take part in the government of their
country.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Education shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship
among nations, and strive by teaching and education to promote respect
for the rights and freedoms.</li>
  <li>Everyone has the right to share in scientific advancement and its
benefits.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Everyone has duties to the community in which the free and full
development of his/her personality is possible.
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE&nbsp; WORLD&nbsp;
PARLIAMENT&nbsp; AS&nbsp; HUMANITY'S&nbsp; BRAIN
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way to
think
about the design of a World Parliament is to imagine it serving as
humanity's
brain.&nbsp; Our brains contain thousands of interconnected neurons. A
multicolored map of cyberspace created by Bill Cheswick and Hal Burch
at
Bell Laboratories appeared in the January 2000 issue of National
Geographic.
The way it was drawn gives the impression of networks of neurons in the
human brain.&nbsp; The connecting links between web sites are analogous
to the dendrites connecting the neurons in the brain. The web sites of
the World Parliament would be world citizens and communities.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishing
a World Parliament and having it serve as humanity's brain is a
daunting&nbsp;
task.&nbsp; Many people will be struggling with it.&nbsp; The idea's
time
has come.&nbsp; As I've immersed myself in it, I've felt the need to
explain
what I think it means to be "humanity".&nbsp; Being humanity?&nbsp;
Humanity
governing itself?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following poem
expresses my thought and blessing for all of us together in
the&nbsp;&nbsp;
world:
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Being Humanity
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Being all women, all men, all children of the whole world
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Being humanity's DNA
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Being in every culture, every religion; believing in every belief that
anyone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
on earth cannot live without
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Being every past human
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Being of every point of view,&nbsp; every belief about everything
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Being the expression of every emotion, every feeling
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Being humanity.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
poem
also describes the task of the World Parliament; being humanity in all
its glory, amazement and nobility.&nbsp; Being humanity as we find ways
to use all our brains in governing ourselves.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Parliament
would operate by the rules of humanity's brain.&nbsp; These rules are
the
tools for humanity using its brain, tools as shown in the previous
chapters.&nbsp;
This book&nbsp; has shown parts of humanity's brain working in natural
governance modes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I've
described
as a World Parliament would be a combination of what was happening in
each
of the tests, a composite of natural governances.&nbsp; The total would
function as natural governance because its components&nbsp; would be
feasible
natural governances.&nbsp; The interfaces between governances would be
points of balanced and expanding reciprocity.&nbsp; An example is the
interface
between the reparative board processes and communities.&nbsp;
Reparative
boards catalyze more effective community governance by making more
opportunities
for reciprocity visible.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each
community
would develop great goals and share them with the world.&nbsp; Each
community
would think through how it is going to get to where it wants to
go.&nbsp;
All communities would share answers.&nbsp; Because natural governance
would
be used throughout the world, there are bound to be similarities
between
ways of working toward the goals in the initial stages.&nbsp; Any
differences
between goals shouldn't get in the way of the initial
reciprocity.&nbsp;
The differences should narrow as cooperation increases at all levels of
natural governance.&nbsp; There would be value in having competition
among
long range goals.&nbsp; It will provide a safety factor, a cushion, a
hedge
to allow for unanticipated contingencies, the continuing flexibility to
change course to reach goals by other routes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Robert
Wright
points out in Nonzero, there is also another safety factor: global
commerce
is expanding to include more and more people.&nbsp; Global business
over
the internet, for example.&nbsp; This gives people a shared interest in
protecting that commerce from friction and disruption.&nbsp; Natural
governance
will expand to help with this protection.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People should
not feel threatened by a World Parliament.&nbsp; Political power would
still remain at the national level within a modified United
Nations.&nbsp;
The power of the World Parliament system would be moral rather than
legal.
Its authority would come from agreement on similar goals and on
appropriate
ways of making progress toward reaching them, similar to the authority
of the special town meetings as shown in the Lexington test.&nbsp;
Funding
for the Parliament would come from an international system of taxation
based on the Gross National Product of all nations.&nbsp; The taxation
would be accepted because natural governance would demonstrate progress
toward pre-negotiated goals.&nbsp; For example, progress on the goal of
extending the healthy years of life, progress which was catalyzed by
the
special town meeting process in Lexington, natural governance in
action.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vision of
Wilson, Clarke, Kurtz, and their associates is precise in its reasoning
and consistent with human nature. Our tests of natural governance have
shown their vision to be feasible.&nbsp; The vision in the Universal
Declaration
of Human Rights is feasible.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
opportunity
to advance natural democracy is to recognize the inherent dignity, and
the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family, so
that all of us may enjoy freedom, justice and peace.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A concurrent
obligation is to understand human nature and devote it to the task of
developing
global natural governance.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our lives
will
be enriched.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will have
decommissioned natural selection.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be
free
to become all we can be.
