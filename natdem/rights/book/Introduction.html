<p style="font-weight: bold;">MAKING&nbsp; TNT&nbsp; AND
RECAPTURING&nbsp; THE&nbsp; JAPANESE
ISLAND
OF&nbsp; OKINAWA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first
part of WWII, as a chemical engineer I could have been deffered to work
in any part of the defence industry. I choose to be more directly
involved.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I decided
to make TNT. It blew up many thousands of Germans and Japanese.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I decided
to become more directly involved. I joined the Navy. My eyes
didn&#8217;t&nbsp;
pass the vision test for submarine duty. So instead, I became a radar
officer
and served on an attack transport.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started up
the Japanese island chain, capturing island by island.&nbsp; At the
battle
of Okinawa on our way to Tokyo, the Japanese &#8220;kamikaze&#8221; planes flew in
strafing us as they came. We stuck back with anti-aircraft guns
bringing
their planes down one by one.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I vividly remember
seeing the body of a Japanese pilot floating by in the current. His
blood
was staining the water. What motivated him to fly was his obedience to
the Japanese Emporer. What motivated me to shoot him down was my desire
to help save democracy. He was doing what he was told to do.&nbsp; I
was
doing what I wanted to do.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been&nbsp;
working ever since on ways of making democracy work even better. That
is the story I will tell in this book
