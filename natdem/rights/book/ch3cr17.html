<p><b>USING OUR GENES TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE CRIME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This chapter
describes the first major test of natural democracy in Vermont.&nbsp;
The
leadership of the Department of Corrections and the Agency of Human
Services
of which it is a part have applied the knowledge of how our genes
control
us. They have used the three steps described in Chapter 2 as a way to
create
new forms of governance and changes in the system of justice.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">REDUCING&nbsp; CRIME </span><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is
the potential for natural governance to reduce crime?&nbsp; Progress
toward
this goal is developing in stages.&nbsp; Becoming conscious of how the
genes control us first led to an understanding of crime as breaches in
reciprocal relationships. With that understanding, we were able to
examine
crime as a result of people reacting naturally to what they perceived
to
be breaches in obligations owed to them and to conditions which locked
them into continuing breaches in reciprocity.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever the
problem, the appropriate action in most cases is to change the
conditions
to those that induce reciprocity. Crime has been a problem where the
past
conditions were leading to consequences of serious concern to all of
us.
It is still&nbsp; a problem in America and the world, as the events of
September 11, 2001 remind us. Vermont is conducting experiments in
applying
the newly acquired knowledge of human nature to help solve the crime
problem
and make the transformations to the conditions that induce the balanced
and expanding reciprocity of natural democracy.<br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">LOOKING&nbsp; FOR ANSWERS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I retired
from Polaroid and left Lexington to live in Vermont&nbsp; back in 1985,
the information about human nature was burning in my brain.&nbsp; I
roared
to the wind, Is this knowledge as earthshaking as it appears to
be?&nbsp;
How can I find out?&nbsp; The answer came back across Willoughby Lake
from&nbsp;
Joseph Patrissi, then Commissioner of Corrections in Vermont.&nbsp; He
shouted, You think you've got some answers?&nbsp; I've got some
problems!&nbsp;&nbsp;
We yelled to each other, Let's build a fire under crime.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We made a deal,
and the flames under crime have been growing ever since. The first
thing
we did was read E. O.. Wilson's&nbsp; On Human Nature.&nbsp; We came
across
the key idea that I had found before in Wilson's writings: "To chart
our
destiny means that we must shift from automatic control based on our
biological
properties to precise steering based on biological knowledge."&nbsp;
For
Joe and me this translated into, "Maybe crime is not entirely the fault
of the criminals.&nbsp; Maybe we're in the mess with crime because we
humans
are letting our biology control us rather than taking charge and
running
the show the way we really want?"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We then said,
"Let's try taking control and see what happens."&nbsp;&nbsp; We asked,
"What does taking control mean?"&nbsp; We knew things weren't going
very
well under automatic control, and Joe was getting political pressure to
change.&nbsp; The public and the governor were both saying, "We're not
going to appropriate any more money to build jails.&nbsp; Your criminal
justice system doesn't seem to be working.&nbsp; Fix it.&nbsp; Don't
duck
by building another prison."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a start,
Joe and I took stock of the crime situation in Vermont.&nbsp; It was
quite
similar to that in most parts of the country.&nbsp; Despite the fact
that
crime was decreasing, the public lacked confidence that the criminal
justice
system would assure its safety.&nbsp; Prisons were regarded as a heavy
tax burden.&nbsp; Sentencing practices varied and often were not fair
or
equitable. Offenders saw other offenders get lesser sentences for the
same
crime they had committed.&nbsp; The interests of the victims and the
community
were not being adequately addressed.&nbsp; The system was focusing
almost
exclusively on the offenders and the laws that had been broken.&nbsp;
The
victims were peripheral.&nbsp; The Department of Corrections had no
time
or budget allocation to involve itself with helping to prevent crime in
the first place.&nbsp; The pressure of overcrowding was draining
resources
and severely limiting the amount of staff time that could go into
rehabilitation
training.&nbsp; The no integrated assessment and the strangers rule
were
controlling behaviors.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">INITIAL STEPS </span><br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The opportunity
that Joe and I needed in order to try out our understanding of human
nature
came in 1988.&nbsp; Unexpectedly, we had our chance to change the
conditions
to those that would induce reciprocity.&nbsp; Our ideas gained a strong
supporter.&nbsp; Vermont's Governor Madeleine Kunin decided that
building
more prisons wasn't the answer to the crime problem.&nbsp; Crime and
prisons
were costing the United States over $100 billion a year.&nbsp; The
governor
focused on two items:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prevention:
keeping crime from happening in the first place
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Alternative
ways of punishing without adding jail space.
<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present
commissioner John Gorczyk tells a story about a man who was walking
along
the bank of a river when he heard a call for help.&nbsp; He saw someone
waving frantically from the water, and without hesitation, took off his
coat and shoes and dove in, swam out to the drowning person, and towed
her to shore.&nbsp; He had no sooner recovered his breath when another
call for help came from the water, and he dove back in, swam out, and
rescued
another person.&nbsp; Again, no sooner had he swum back to shore, when
there was a third call.&nbsp; He dove in, and while he was swimming
out,
some other folks came along and gave the rescued people
assistance.&nbsp;
He got back with the third victim, and looked out, and sure enough,
here
was a fourth one calling for help. He sat down on the bank, put his
shoes
on, stood up and put his coat on.&nbsp; One of the newcomers said "what
are you doing -- there's somebody drowning out there!"&nbsp; He said,
"You
go rescue him -- I'm going back upstream to find out who's throwing
people
into the river!"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Governor Kunin
insisted that we go back up stream.&nbsp; She realized, as we did, that
breaches in reciprocity in children's lives were leading&nbsp; to
crime.&nbsp;
Her list of breaches included child abuse, domestic violence, absent
fathers,
and mothers on drugs.&nbsp; Intuitively she was searching for ways to
encourage
communities to balance reciprocity -- for example, ways of getting
deadbeat
dads to pay up and do their share of raising their children.&nbsp; Even
if a father did no more than pay child support, that would free the
mother
to give more love to the child, which would in turn enhance his or her
creativity and security, and hence the ability to reciprocate later as
a productive member of the community.&nbsp; This scenario probably
sounds
obvious, but many people do not understand the connections.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of Governor
Kunin's initiatives was to set up an advisory committee on house arrest
as an alternative to prison, confining offenders to their homes rather
than jail.&nbsp; She invited me to serve on her Community Control/House
Arrest Advisory Committee&nbsp; to help address the question, "What
types
of crime could be punished with house arrest?"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In examining
that question, the committee studied the Willie Horton television
commercial
used by Republicans that was so influential in the 1988 presidential
campaign.&nbsp;
The Democratic candidate, Massachusetts' Governor Michael Dukakis, was
accused of being soft on crime.&nbsp; His administration had allegedly
granted Horton a weekend furlough during which he went on a rampage of
rape and murder. Our committee analyzed the commercial sponsored by
candidate
George Bush's people. We looked at the responses to the ad, and the
consequences
of the responses.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commercial
evoked anxiety.&nbsp; Rape and murder have a way of doing that.
Horton's
fierce, glaring face forced the initial anxiety of the viewers to turn
into fear and anger.&nbsp; The strangers rule was controlling and was
being
exploited to the hilt and unfairly by the creators of the
commercial.&nbsp;
The fear and anger grew with repeated viewings.&nbsp; The public had no
way to relate to Horton.&nbsp; Nothing about him connected with their
lives.&nbsp;
This estrangement was reinforced by knowing that he was an accused
rapist
and came from the inner city, which for many viewers had negative
connotations.&nbsp;
No information was provided for viewers to understand such ameliorating
factors as the very low frequency with which inmates breach the trust
implicit
in a furlough.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here was the no-integrated-assessment
tendency
in action.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Democratic
presidential campaign had no time to communicate these complex factors
to the public.&nbsp; The rationale for furlough can't be explained in
thirty-second
sound bytes. The commercial was aired late in the campaign, so that
there
was no time to get the praiseworthy track record of furlough and
subsequent
rehabilitation across to the public.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the ad
was
designed to plant guilt, humiliation and embarrassment in the hearts of
those who had approved&nbsp; the furlough policy -- Governor Dukakis,
for
one.&nbsp; Viewers had paid their taxes to support&nbsp; prisons in the
expectation that they would be protected.&nbsp; Thus reciprocity had
been
breached.&nbsp; Emotions ran high.&nbsp; It was obvious to our Kunin
committee
that the good intentions of Governor Dukakis and his staff to
rehabilitate
offenders had backfired.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insights from
the study of this commercial showed potential pitfalls in the house
arrest
program.&nbsp; We saw clearly that if offenders who had committed
serious
crimes were put on house arrest, and then repeated a violent offense,
it
would cause considerable embarrassment for the governor, despite a
careful
design that excluded offenders with any potential for violence.&nbsp;
The
committee reviewed with the Department of Corrections its screening
process,
its policies on granting furloughs, and its use of house
arrest.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This process opened our thinking about the public's role in responding
to crime -- for example, should the public have a role in granting
furloughs?&nbsp;
Remember that Joe Patrissi and I had in mind the insight about each of
us moving away from unconscious control of our brains by our genes and
replacing auto-piloting with self-piloting.&nbsp; Maybe the public's
lack
of involvement in the furlough process was preventing the public's
opportunity
to make integrated assessments.&nbsp; If that were the case, it would
account
for the public's not realizing its responsibility for this particular
public
policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We examined ways to give the public more control
over
crime.&nbsp; The public's natural desire for autonomy -- being in
control
of their own lives -- was being thwarted by the conditions of the
system.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We then asked ourselves, how did Willie Horton get into trouble in the
first place?&nbsp; What was the public's role in that?&nbsp; We were
prepared
to go pretty deeply into what crime was all about.&nbsp; We began to
realize
just how much automatic control by our biology was hurting.&nbsp; It
was
killing people.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We traced
many of the causes of crime to features in the social environment which
prevent reciprocity from functioning.&nbsp; As an example, we looked at
the intense time demands on families where both parents are
working.&nbsp;
Frequently, parents don't have enough time to nurture their
children.&nbsp;
Nurturing is the initial part of a reciprocity cycle.&nbsp; Nurturing
can
be regarded both as an obligation that accompanies bringing children
into
the world and as a favor to them which results in returns on that
investment.&nbsp;
The favor of nurturing keeps children away from bad habits and
inculcates
good ones; it positions children to return the favor at a later time in
their lives as they become productive citizens. The favor becomes a
benefit.
That insight led us to a sounder definition of actions the public could
take to prevent crime. We asked ourselves, what is keeping the public
from
taking on more responsibility for causes of crime?&nbsp; Not only for
the
causes but also for the punishment?&nbsp; Why was the public breaching
what appeared to be its obligation to take on more responsibility for
the
causes of crime within our communities?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee
returned to human nature.&nbsp; We put our understanding of it to
work.&nbsp;
We realized that the no-integrated-assessment tendency limited the
public's
vision of effective solutions to crime.&nbsp; "Out of sight, out of
mind."&nbsp;
We thought about ways to compensate for this tendency, ways that would
produce the reciprocity that we could see was lacking.&nbsp; The
committee's
recommendations to Governor Kunin in December 1988 took into account
the
responsibility of a well-informed public, particularly parents.&nbsp;
We
recommended a public information program to encourage dialogue on the
problem
of crime in each community's governance process.&nbsp; We said the job
of preventing crime has to be integrated into every aspect of each
community's&nbsp;
future, including its education, its social services , and its business
development.&nbsp; It's everybody's job.&nbsp; We also recommended that
the Department of Corrections (DOC) explore more alternatives to
incarceration.&nbsp;
Prison didn't seem to be working well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We insisted that
responsibility for rehabilitation and reparation be shared with each
community.&nbsp;
We felt that the department was trying to do too much by itself, not
involving
the public where the public could help.&nbsp; Joe Patrissi and his
staff
were already thinking about this before our committee got into the
picture.&nbsp;
But when these ideas bubbled up within the committee, we realized that
the social environment needed to allow effective operation of natural
reciprocity
and other life-enhancing tendencies.&nbsp; With these tendencies in
mind,
alternatives to incarceration needed to be designed to provide more
opportunities
for reciprocal exchange between offenders and the people in each
community.&nbsp;
The offenders would do work on community projects.&nbsp; The community
would provide opportunities for the offenders to do so, and would
reward
the offenders with thanks.&nbsp; They would return to the community as
productive citizens.&nbsp; Since these exchanges would happen beyond
the
walls of the prisons, the offenders would be visible to the whole
community.&nbsp;
Notice how we were taking the epigenetic rules into account: not only
reciprocity,
but also the strangers rule and the desire for status.&nbsp; In
addition,
the system should be designed to evoke gratitude.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I look back
on the committee's central recommendation to the governor, it has
resulted
in the department expanding its use of the more accurate understanding
of human nature.&nbsp; We simply knew that this new perspective was
going
to be essential.&nbsp; Back in 1990, we felt there were too many "Band
Aids".&nbsp; We said, "Let's get basic". Everybody wants real and
lasting
solutions.&nbsp; We want realistic alternatives to the present waste as
offenders do "jail time."&nbsp; We charged ahead into what has now
become
an essential part of the journey toward natural governance and
democracy.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">REVISING&nbsp; CORRECTIONS&nbsp;
POLICIES&nbsp; BY&nbsp;
TAKING&nbsp;
CONSCIOUS&nbsp; CONTROL OF OUR GENES</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experience
of working with the Community Control/House Arrest Advisory Committee
brought
the commissioner and his staff to ask for further training in taking
human
nature into account.&nbsp; I turned to Dr. Richard Williams, a
psychologist
and manager at Polaroid Corporation, to conduct a series of workshops
that
included senior staff members of the department and some members of the
advisory committee.&nbsp; Williams had worked with me at Polaroid
Corporation
in applying the insights about human nature to product
design.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He gave the DOC staff a five-day tutorial on the tendencies of human
nature
and the basic problem of being unconsciously controlled by them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step
for the DOC was to practice this new understanding of human nature by
doing
what Patrissi called calisthenics -- experiential learning.&nbsp; Joe,
his second in command John Gorczyk and now commissioner, and John
Perry,
the department's director of planning, pitched in to get hands-on
experience.&nbsp;
These people were enduring the same problems as their counterparts in
other
states: overcrowding, tight budgets, and increased demand in the face
of
decreasing crime.&nbsp; They faced a constant demand for instant, easy
answers to complex problems ranging from release policies to
multimillion-dollar
capital investments.&nbsp; Patrissi, Gorczyk, and Perry are men of the
sixties: all three started their careers in the criminal justice system
full of idealism; all three had deep convictions about the inadequacies
of the system.&nbsp; They knew it wasn't working and wanted to change
it.&nbsp;
They were open to anything that would work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I moved from my committee
role to directly helping them with the changes.&nbsp; We said, "This
way
of thinking is powerful".&nbsp; We started stretching our
imaginations.&nbsp;
We said, "Let's move away from this history of automatic control.&nbsp;
Let's change to more conscious control.&nbsp; Let's see if we can
restructure
the department so as to take human nature more fully into account, to
Vermont's
advantage."&nbsp; This would be a major transformation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About this time,
John Gorczyk took over as commissioner of corrections.&nbsp; Gorczyk
challenged
us with these insights about the history of causes of correctional
problems:
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">INSIGHTS&nbsp; FROM&nbsp; OUR&nbsp;
HISTORY
OF CRIME AND PUNISHMENT</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to
Gorczyk, "crime" represents an individual's taking something of value
from
another without returning something of equal or greater value.&nbsp;
When
a violation of that contract, which has been designated as a "crime",
is
reported, government is then asked to intervene using the criminal
justice
system to verify the allegations of the victim and hold the offending
party
accountable.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increasingly
over the past decades, the philosophy which drives the methodology for
holding the offender accountable has been described as "Just
Deserts."&nbsp;
The amount of punishment should be equivalent in value (emotional,
material,
and quality of life) to the loss experienced by the victim and
community
in which the crime occurred.&nbsp; The result is described as having
balanced
or equalized the relationship and that "Justice" has somehow been
achieved.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty
with this 900+- year-old (since William the Conqueror) colonial,
retributive
approach to "Justice" is that it uses arithmetic which operates
exclusively
with negative outcomes.&nbsp; Reducing the offender to a level of "pain
and suffering" equivalent to that of the victim and community may
respond
to a visceral need for revenge or retaliation, but it fails entirely to
respond to the material and quality of life needs of the victim and the
community.&nbsp; The victim of the burglary does not have her sense of
safety and security restored.&nbsp; Instead, the victim is largely
ignored
by the criminal justice system, except for requirements for further
disruption
of the victim's life by being a witness for the prosecution.&nbsp; Then
on top of it all, the victim is asked to pay increased taxes to
incarcerate
the perpetrator of the crime.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure of
this process becomes even more apparent when the long-term consequences
are considered.&nbsp; These include the near-total dissatisfaction of
the
public with the criminal justice system; the crisis of overcrowded
prisons;
the negative impact of the cost of prison construction on higher
education,
public schools; all of which reduce the quality of life.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes the
social contract work is the addition of value, not the removal of
value.&nbsp;
Human beings reciprocate.&nbsp; If someone does us a favor, we feel a
sense
of obligation to repay the favor with another. If crime is a violation
of this exchange agreement (social contract), then to be effective, the
justice system must work to return real value that is visible to the
harmed
parties, the victim and the community, and the offenders, as happens in
the Vermont reparative justice process.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The history of
how societies have changed the social contract over time is revealing.
If we had been living in an isolated ninth century Welsh village, the
odds
would be that if I had stolen from you, I would be outlawed, and driven
from the village.&nbsp; My family would be disgraced, and would have to
pay the victim for his losses, and more, to make up for the
offense.&nbsp;
So I wouldn't steal from you.&nbsp; What does this have to do with
justice
in America?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rule of law
is a record of what has been decided to be wrong, and what has worked
in
response, at least in Anglo-Saxon culture that is a thousand or so
years
old.&nbsp; It is our collective memory of negative reciprocities --
defining
the behaviors that don't work and trying to create a response to each
one
that will deter others form doing the same thing.&nbsp; By and large,
our
definition of the behaviors that don't work hasn't changed much; theft
is still theft, even though you do it on the internet, and murder is
still
murder. What we have spent the last thousand years doing is
experimenting
with punishments.&nbsp; We keep trying to find out what works.&nbsp;
During
the Dark Ages, the Northern European/Scandinavian model of criminal
justice
focused on the families of the accused and the victim. Crime was seen
as
harm to the victim, and her family was entitled to compensation for the
loss.&nbsp; The compensation came from the family of the
offender.&nbsp;
Thus, the criminal disgraced his own family.&nbsp; His offense was
costly
to them.&nbsp; The elders of the village decided on the
compensation.&nbsp;
Justice was focused on the victim and the harm done to reputations.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gorczyk went
on to tell that the Norman Conquest changed all that.&nbsp; William the
Conqueror was an invader, and like all colonial powers, he was not
interested
in enhancing the wealth and safety of the Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp; His
interest
was in paying off the vassals who had come with him on the invasion,
and
in shipping as much wealth as he could back home.&nbsp; He was also in
debt.&nbsp; He had rented all the boats on the coast of Normandy to
carry
his army across the channel, and he had to pay owners.&nbsp; He could
pay
off the vassals with land and booty, but for the ship-owners and for
his
own treasury, he needed cash in a hurry.&nbsp; So he implemented the
Norman
Rule of Law.&nbsp; This was the southern European form of law that was
based on Roman law.&nbsp; Under this feudal system, a crime against a
vassal
of the king was a crime against the crown itself, and thus any penalty
was owed to the king's treasury.&nbsp; The restitution of the victim's
family was irrelevant.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took William
about six years to completely replace the justice system in England.
Ever
since, we have been trying to undo the damage caused by this
heritage.&nbsp;
The reparative boards system is another step in that direction.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMINING THE DEPARTMENT'S HISTORY</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gorczyk's insights
precipitated a thorough re-evaluation of the DOC's role in the light of
our understanding of human nature.&nbsp; For about a hundred years, the
department had been heavily influenced by the two-part-classification
tendency.&nbsp;
People sentenced for crimes were sorted into two categories: those
serving
time in prison and those on probation out free in the community.&nbsp;
Prison or free.&nbsp; Incarceration costs about $30,000 per inmate per
year; probation costs about $700.&nbsp; The prevailing public rationale
was that people in prison must be dangerous, so it was all right to
spend
a lot on them because the public needed to be protected.&nbsp; People
in
the probation category must not have posed a threat since they were not
in prison; so there was no sense spending much money on them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did we arrive
at this way of thinking?&nbsp; How did it get started?&nbsp; Long ago,
when there was close association between people in their communities,
deception
and crimes were more easily detected.&nbsp; Punishment was rare,
because
it was necessary to repair the damage to the community and family,
rather
than merely punish. When punishment was meted it occurred swiftly and
the
families of the victims and offenders were involved in the
punishment.&nbsp;
As the population grew, the task of controlling crime became much more
complex.&nbsp; Societies moved to incarceration of offenders.&nbsp;
Epigenetic
rules such as the tendency toward two-part classification, no
integrated
assessment, and deception grew to wield a stronger influence.&nbsp; The
strangers tendency came into play.&nbsp; By hiding offenders from
public
view, public interest and true assessment of public responsibility
disappeared.&nbsp;
The personal obligation to prevent crime and participate in its
punishment
was swept under the rug or delegated to people in the criminal justice
system.&nbsp; It became a casualty of distortions in reciprocity.&nbsp;
The inmate was viewed as a tax burden. The cost of incarceration was
perceived
as greater than the benefit to the public.&nbsp; Reciprocity was being
breached because most inmates were not visibly paying back their
victims
or the public.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the
history.&nbsp; Invisible offenders behind bars, free probationers loose
in the community, and nothing in between.&nbsp;&nbsp; Human nature's
tendency
toward two-part classification expressed itself here.&nbsp; It was in
control.
My question was, should it be controlling? And if not, what other
tendency
or tendencies do we want to be controlling?&nbsp; If we consciously
take
back the control of deviant behavior, what tendency do we want to put
in
its place?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This two-part classification
of criminals has long been embodied in law and tradition, but the
department's
experience and similar occurrences all over the United States show that
it is not valid.&nbsp; The department came to realize that in many
cases
a middle ground was needed between incarceration and probation; human
nature,
including criminal behavior, does not always organize itself into two
neat
packages.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">FINDING A REMEDY</span>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DOC set about
to remedy this ineffective tradition by developing a new category for
offenders
that included an intermediate legal status for them, something between
probation and prison. The previous two-part classification of offenders
into prison and nonprison, safe and dangerous, treatable and
incorrigible,
lacked a middle ground.&nbsp; The department moved away from its own
parochial
views. It shifted to a better understanding of the needs of its
constituents
and customers.&nbsp; It examined the purposes of corrections from the
perspectives
of the public, the government, and the various parts of the criminal
justice
system.&nbsp; It recognized that the rationale underlying all these
purposes
was to rebalance reciprocity, to mend breaches in reciprocity.&nbsp;
With
this in mind, the department carefully analyzed reciprocity in the
system,
taking into account social roles and obligations within the community,
including the obligation to the victim of crime, the community's
obligation
to punish the offender, the offender's obligation to pay back the
victim.&nbsp;
And then came the really important insight: the community's obligation
to help both the victim and the offender to restore a balance in
reciprocity.&nbsp;
Maybe solving society's crime problem starts with digging deep enough
into
the fundamental characteristics of human nature.&nbsp; One of the
findings
from that dig may be that reciprocity may be the key to solving crime.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crime is the
breakdown in reciprocity by the offender -- for example, stealing money
rather than earning it through service.&nbsp; Murder, rape, and assault
are gross distortions, the ultimate destructions of reciprocal
relationships,
breakdowns in obligation.&nbsp; Normal reciprocal exchanges create
gratitude.&nbsp;
Crime twists this normal gratitude into anger and resentment.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took a leap
at redefining the central objective of corrections: to mend breaches in
reciprocity, and to do this by acting as the public's agent in helping
the public and the offenders to do the mending.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In John Perry's
words: "The fundamental disappointment...expressed by the public was
rooted
in the inability of the criminal justice system to respond to the
public's
need for safety from predators and to provide a sense of restoration of
order and restitution for the wrong done.&nbsp; In addition, there were
needs for an apology to the victims, return of the taken, repair of the
broken, and a guarantee as a bond for future behavior."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The department
proceeded to draft and support legislation titled "An Act Relating to
Alternatives
to Incarceration" (S.300).&nbsp; Passed and signed by Governor Kunin on
June 27, 1990, the legislation provided the opportunity to tailor a
sentence
to the criminal and the crime.&nbsp; Prisons were overcrowded with
offenders
who could have been effectively punished by alternatives less costly
and
more rehabilitative than incarceration.&nbsp; Criminals were either in
the community on probation or they were gone -- behind bars, and those
that returned from prison were many times prevented from making amends
because they were labeled dangerous.&nbsp; "Don't trust them. They have
a prison record."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legislation
was designed to permit and encourage "more direct community involvement
in making offenders accountable, getting offenders to contract to
acknowledge
their crimes, repair damage, return value to the community, take
responsibility
for personal change, and provide restitution to victims in a manner
that
is timely and complete."&nbsp; It called for "community-based
rehabilitation
programs for offenders who do not pose a substantial risk of harm to
the
public."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We took human
nature into account in this design, basing everything on the
reciprocity
principle.&nbsp; The objective was to reestablish the chain of favors
that
had been broken by the offender.&nbsp; We wanted to get the normal
cycle
of exchanges going again.&nbsp; Our aim was to have the offender bring
himself or herself back into the cycle.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting this
legislation passed was a three-month process involving the department's
new understanding of human nature.&nbsp; Passage required cooperation
with
the prosecutors, the judiciary and court administrator, the parole
board,
the defense bar, the public defender, the police, the corrections
staff,
the victims' advocates, the attorney general, the governor's office,
the
media, and most important, the judiciary committees and the
institutions
committees of the senate and house.&nbsp; Before the law could be
enacted,
its benefits to each of these stakeholders had to be clearly
visible.&nbsp;
The&nbsp; reciprocity principle guided the DOC to assure these groups
that
the benefits would outweigh any perceived cost.&nbsp; For example,
victims'
advocates were assured that paying back the victim would be built into
the process.&nbsp; That assurance is a necessary requirement for the
long-term
success of reciprocal exchanges.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perry said in
retrospect: "We began to understand the different needs and
expectations
of each person and group with a stake in the prosecution of the crime
and
the differing views&nbsp; that each had of the offender and of
punishment.&nbsp;
Thinking through the human nature tendencies impinging on the operation
of the criminal justice system has provided significant insight into
shifting
our mission, from treating and controlling offenders to serving the
needs
of the victims and the community for restoration to a previous social
order."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the transition
from automatic control, we took into account that the public lacked
confidence
in the criminal justice system, mainly because lay people weren't
associated
closely enough with the system.&nbsp; The public didn't understand
enough
of what was going on to take an active part in fixing the system.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In effect, what
the DOC did was to invent a form of natural governance in criminal
justice
which involved the public.&nbsp; Its primary tool for doing this was to
design into its system features that induced reciprocity and a specific
sequence of emotions that detected and punished deception.&nbsp; The
department
incorporated sufficient close association between the offender and
community
representatives.&nbsp; It was designed for visibility of the offender
within
the community, another way of meeting the requirement for close
association.&nbsp;
It was designed so that the system provided for the offender to make
amends
by doing favors for past breaches in reciprocity.&nbsp; The program
produced
significant benefits for the victim and the public that were within the
capacity of the offender.&nbsp; It was also designed to detect any
cheating
during the restoration.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">THE REPARATIVE SYSTEM
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This form of
natural governance is designed to put into practice an understanding of
human nature.&nbsp; The department of corrections has allowed
communities
throughout the state to set up reparative boards.&nbsp; These boards
are
composed of five or six volunteer community members.&nbsp; They meet
with
offenders who have been sentenced to appear before them.&nbsp; They
look
these offenders in the eye. They confront them with the harm they have
done.&nbsp; The face-to-face confrontation is powerful.&nbsp; The board
members are the community.&nbsp; They are the neighbors.&nbsp; They are
the public.&nbsp; In effect, the community is determining punishment,
deciding
with offenders how they will best atone for what they have done.&nbsp;
The offenders participate in that decision.&nbsp; By doing so, they
come
to see the rightness of it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The composition
of the reparative boards assures involvement of cross-sections of
communities.&nbsp;
One typical board consists of the owner of the local grocery store, an
insurance broker, a teacher, a college student, a police officer, and a
restaurant owner.&nbsp;&nbsp; The college student has a bachelor's
degree
in criminal justice, and she is getting her master's degree in
behavioral
science and social&nbsp; work.&nbsp; Each board member received
training
before hearing cases.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About sixty of
the boards started operating in 1994.&nbsp; The communities in which
they
function vary in size between a thousand and thirty-five thousand
people,
from the very small to the largest.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a typical
case in Rutland, the offender had been convicted of drunk
driving.&nbsp;
The&nbsp; board invited his wife and other family members to be present
at the hearing.&nbsp; His wife told the board that her only concern was
that the offender do something about his alcohol abuse.&nbsp; It was
hurting
the family badly, and endangering the whole community.&nbsp; In an
extended
meeting, the board was able to convince the offender to enter a
residential
treatment program at his own expense.&nbsp; After going through that
program,
he appeared before the board again so it could make sure the program
had
been effective.&nbsp; It had been, with a lot of family support.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This case is
an example of the reciprocity principle in action.&nbsp; The community,
through the reparative board, does the offender the favor of suggesting
that he take the treatment program.&nbsp; The offender does his family
a favor by taking it.&nbsp; The family does the offender a favor by
giving
him encouragement and support during the treatment.&nbsp; The four
conditions
that induce reciprocity are created -- close association with family
members
and the community; opportunities for reciprocity. The benefits to the
offender,
his family, and the community are much greater than the time taken by
the
board to help. Any cheating would have been detected by the man's
family
and by monitoring of the board during the treatment.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a case before
one of the Burlington boards, a bank teller had stolen from his fellow
tellers and customers and was convicted on two counts of petty
larceny.&nbsp;
The board asked him to pay back all his victims, do sixty-seven hours
of
community service, tour the local prison, write a "reflection paper,"
and
at his own expense take a course in making decisions.&nbsp; By thinking
in reciprocity terms, the board allowed the mending of the breaches in
imaginative ways that would have been impossible if the offender had
been
incarcerated.&nbsp; For example, the threat of a subsequent prison term
was made by opening up the teller's thinking during a tour of the local
jail -- the indirect message was that if you do any more of this, here
are the consequences. The specter of these consequences was reinforced
by the offender's reflection paper and the course in decision
making.&nbsp;
Two hours of the board's time saved every taxpayer in the state the
cost
of a prison term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boards match
the community service to the capabilities of the offender. For example,
a civil engineer was asked to do work for the road commissioner in
Charlotte,
Vermont.&nbsp; His road design assignment saved the town considerable
expense.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As one board
member put it, "Experience with offenders shows that they have to feel
something before they recognize it.&nbsp; For instance, somebody who is
an alcoholic has to feel what it's like to be sober before they know
the
difference.&nbsp; They have to feel something within themselves that is
going to show them the&nbsp; difference between the negative and the
positive.&nbsp;
The same thing works for the community, too.&nbsp; The community has to
feel the beneficial consequences of the offenders doing things out
there
before it is going to accept the fact that they are out there and not
in
jail."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many offenders
feel as if they've never accomplished anything in their lives.&nbsp;
Here's
an example of a board giving an offender a chance to accomplish
something
significant.&nbsp; In a snowstorm, an elderly woman called a board
member
and said she couldn't get out her door because the snow was so
high.&nbsp;
Offenders on community service went to her home and shoveled her
out.&nbsp;
They came back and said, "You should have seen that poor woman!&nbsp;
How
would she have gotten out if it hadn't been for us?"&nbsp;&nbsp; As the
board member put it, "It's like all of a sudden their eyes are seeing
something
besides breaking into these elderly homes and taking what they can and
terrorizing the elderly poor.&nbsp; The offenders shine in that kind of
gratitude.&nbsp; Past feelings of anger fade away.&nbsp; The elderly
don't
have to say anything except thank you and that makes these young men
feel
so good.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the very start
of the program, many of these elderly were shocked when they saw
offenders
out in the community. They are criminals!&nbsp; But they soon forgot
about
that!&nbsp; Now they think it's the kids next door and that it's
wonderful;
neighbor kids who are doing all these chores.&nbsp; Board members
receive
many calls saying, "Now don't you send me anybody who is going to take
anything in my house."&nbsp; These board members get another call a
short
time later telling them, "What a wonderful gentleman you sent down to
help
us."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's another
example of how the reparative board system accomplishes something more
than the old system.&nbsp; A college student in Burlington was
convicted
of a hate crime of disturbing the peace by telephone.&nbsp; He pleaded
guilty and was sentenced to&nbsp; reparative probation.&nbsp; At the
board
meeting the victim, an African-American activist member of the Alliance
Against Racism, played a tape of one of the harassing calls that he had
received.&nbsp; Everyone present was disgusted with the vulgarity
expressed
on the tape.&nbsp; The board asked the offender to acknowledge his
guilt.&nbsp;
The offender refused, saying that he had not made the calls but only
pleaded
guilty because his phone had been used for the calls.&nbsp; The board
delayed
action on the case until the offender went to the Burlington Police
Department
and named the friends who had made the calls from his phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boards take the
time to get to the bottom of a case like this.&nbsp; They fit an
appropriate
punishment to the offense and the victim's feelings.&nbsp; Had the
college
student been sentenced to normal probation, he would quite probably
have
paid his fine, kept his mouth shut, been kept on probation for a year,
and his case closed.&nbsp; The real culprits would still be
unaccountable.&nbsp;
The community outrage would not have had an adequate response.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example of
how the boards create ways for offenders to feel shame for what they
have
done wrong is a case in which an offender left the scene of an accident
he had caused while under the influence.&nbsp; The board obtained an
agreement
from him to serve as a designated driver for eight Saturday nights at a
well-known watering hole.&nbsp; He was asked to explain why he was
serving
in this capacity while he was there.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example
of instilling a discrete amount of guilt is the case of a mother who
was
convicted of stealing at a grocery store.&nbsp; Her eight-year-old son
was with her.&nbsp; The board negotiated with her to do community
service
at her son's school, reminding her that her son was affected by her
crime,
too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an offender
comes initially to a reparative board meeting, the first thing the
board
usually sees is anger.&nbsp; He blames everyone except himself.&nbsp;
It's
everybody else's fault.&nbsp; If it weren't for his brother who led him
astray, or if it weren't his mother or father who wouldn't give him
what
he wanted and needed, then it was the lawyer or the judge, or, or. . .
He doesn't think anything is fair.&nbsp; The reasons for this anger can
generally be traced by the board to a series of breaches in
reciprocity.&nbsp;
The offender may have come from a family that gave him everything but
discipline.&nbsp;
He may have received more material things than love, so the source of
the
anger may be because he was shortchanged on that central emotion.&nbsp;
Board members find themselves needing to deal with this anger, the
sputtering
and the resentment.&nbsp; The board's task is to help the offender
convert
these feelings to remorse and then pride as he works to help the
community.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several
members
of the DOC are playing new roles as staff&nbsp; to the reparative
boards.&nbsp;
They follow up on the contracts that have been negotiated by the board
with the offender.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some staff members have become
supervisors
who take the offender work crews out into the community.&nbsp; These
supervisors
are great mentors; while they are taking their "kids" to the workplace,
they talk about school if the offenders have dropped out.&nbsp; If the
offenders don't have jobs, the supervisors will ride by a place where
there
may be an opening and say, "Why don't you run in there?&nbsp; I'll wait
for you.&nbsp; You get an application and I'll help you fill it out."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An encouraging
trend toward a more integrated assessment, looking at how everything
ties
together, is reported by board member Maggie Hawksworth.&nbsp; She says
that the board she serves on has broadened the scope of its
deliberations
to include assessments of education opportunities that reduce the
likelihood
of reoffense.&nbsp; Here's an example: several offenders appearing
before
her board were school dropouts because they weren't learning and had no
interest in doing so.&nbsp; In her words, they were square pegs in
round
holes.&nbsp; Maggie is now working with the teachers at the local high
school to build more relevance into the courses: creating bridges
between
the school and the industries in the area that are bringing local
company
people into the classrooms to dialogue with the students.&nbsp; What's
important to learn and why?&nbsp; How does it get used?&nbsp; How does
learning it increase the opportunities to get a high-paying job?&nbsp;
This is also another illustration of the reciprocity epigenetic rule in
action.&nbsp; By coming to the teachers with real-life opportunities to
increase the motivation for young people to stay in school, a favor to
the students and teachers, Maggie increased the capabilities of the
square-peg
students to reciprocate as productive members of the workforce --
return
of the favor, with higher benefits to the community than the cost of
bringing
more relevance to the curriculum.&nbsp; The important new message is
not
about bringing business people into the classrooms; a lot of that was
happening
already. Rather, the message is that tying the criminal justice system
more fully into the community through the reparative board process is
causing
a significant increase in the bridging between business and education.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crime makes eye-catching
headlines.&nbsp; One of the side effects is that the DOC is an easy
target
for criticism by the media when prisoners are released before their
full
sentence has been served.&nbsp; Here's a case where the no integrated
assessment
epigenetic rule was showing up again.&nbsp; When some of us called the
local newspaper to task for not realizing why this early release was
justified,
the press dug deeper, with our help.&nbsp; What the reporter found was
that this early-release policy made sense in light of the need of the
offender
for careful reintegration and support.&nbsp; Given the overcrowding in
the prisons, it was more sensible to use the limited space for violent
offenders who had just committed a crime.&nbsp; The reporter
subsequently
educated the public about this policy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, this
reparative process has reduced the number of low-risk offenders who
would
have been placed on probation with its risk of going to jail. One of
the
obvious benefits is the financial saving to the public. Even more
important,
in many cases the offenders come out of the reparation experience with
changed attitudes.&nbsp; They really understand the unfairness of their
wrongdoing and feel good about what they've done to repair the
damage.&nbsp;
Their lives change.&nbsp; They become productive citizens.&nbsp; As one
member of a local fire department put it, "Boy, these offenders have
done
our department more good -- in their service work of repairing the
firehouse
-- than they've ever done harm."&nbsp; The offenders hear that and they
love it.&nbsp; Their status goes up.&nbsp; Shame, remorse, and guilt
are
converted into respect and pride. It is another step toward making
natural
governance a reality.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">RESULTS AND BENEFITS
FROM THE REPARATIVE SYSTEM</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, this Vermont-grown
reparative process is spreading throughout the United States and
beyond.&nbsp;
The results: tax saving, community involvement, and citizen
satisfaction.
The price tag for community members is that they may find themselves
participating
as reparative board members at some point.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People
who apply the understanding of human nature in this particular area of
natural governance often see the experience from their own unique
perspective.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commissioner
John Gorczyk makes the argument that the implicit "social contract"
that
binds us all together in a civilized world is explicitly violated
whenever
a crime is committed.&nbsp; He equates this contract with the
reciprocity
epigenetic rule.&nbsp; He understands that reciprocity works best when
the exchange of favors is frequent and visible. Consequently, he sees
failure
to reciprocate as a breach of the implicit social contract.&nbsp; If it
involves deception or cheating, the crime can be the violation of a
formal
or informal exchange relationship.&nbsp; Violent crime can be seen as
using
coercion rather than participating in an exchange.&nbsp; The "crime"
represents
an individual's taking something of value from another without
returning
something of equal or greater value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Gorczyk sees
the basic problem with addressing crime in the United States, the
second
half of the reciprocity cycle is missing.&nbsp; Bringing the offender
to
a level of pain and suffering equivalent to that experienced by the
victim
and community may answer to a visceral need for revenge or retaliation,
but it fails entirely to respond to the material needs and quality of
life
of the victim and the community.&nbsp; As the examples in this chapter
have illustrated, he has incorporated the second half of the
reciprocity
cycle.&nbsp; You've seen how the reparative boards insist on integrated
assessment by getting at the real "whys" of the crime, and what needs
to
be done to bring about a fully just solution.&nbsp; They get the
offender
to stop self-deception.&nbsp; They break through the anxiety of the
strangers
rule by developing a rapport with the offender.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thinking
processes required for using their deeper understanding of human nature
work well for Gorczyk, Perry, Patrissi and me as reported in Chapter
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But we acknowledge that other people should apply their unique
understanding
in whatever ways work best for them.&nbsp; The name of the game, as we
see it, is to determine which epigenetic rule tendencies are generating
the problem and which tendencies can create a different outcome.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the methods
Gorczyk, Perry, Patrissi and I use in applying epigenetic rules answer
two primary questions: What is going on, and why?&nbsp; What could go
on,
and why?&nbsp; The innovative answers they get come from digging deeper
into human nature and the biology behind it.&nbsp; All of us gain
confidence
from this digging, assurance that we are on the right track.&nbsp; It
feels
right both for the organization and for personal reasons.&nbsp; What
had
appeared strange to them when they were first introduced to these
concepts
has become familiar, logical, and personally helpful.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This kind of
questioning has lead Gorczyk and Perry to take a second look at the
whole
governance process.&nbsp; They realize that these insights about human
nature disclose significant opportunities for change in the
relationships
between government, community, family, and individuals.&nbsp; In their
words: "For sixty years or more, government programs have increasingly
bypassed the community and the family to deliver services directly to
individuals.&nbsp;
While this was done for seemingly good and cogent reason the process
had
the unintended consequence of disenfranchising both the traditional
community
governance role in mediating behavior and the family's authority.&nbsp;
It is time to return power to the community and responsibility to the
family,
with government providing the resources and support."&nbsp;&nbsp; They
say, "we know that the village model works -- small groups, female
nurturing
model, cognitive self-change in heterogeneous grouping, face-to-face
problem-solving,
acknowledgment of responsibility, making amends, repairing the damage,
reconciliation and forgiveness. We are designed to forgive and
reconcile
when it is in our interest.&nbsp; We forgive those whom we judge to be
of value to us and those who recognize us as valuable to them, and from
whom we and they expect future interaction."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From their position
in the middle of the pain caused by crime, Gorczyk, Perry, and others
are
crying out for changes.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are turning to these insights
about human nature as one would reach for a life preserver in a
storm-tossed
ocean -- the ocean of ignorance about what makes us who we are.&nbsp;
They
feel the tug at the other end of the rope -- deeper understanding of
self
and the world.
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">CONCLUSIONS
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What have we
accomplished?&nbsp; Vermont has set up a system for giving the public
much
more of a say in criminal justice.&nbsp; It's working.&nbsp; What are
the
implications?&nbsp; As John Gorczyk points out, this view of the
justice
system may appear radical, and it is.&nbsp; For a long time we have
increasingly
centralized the administration of justice,&nbsp; focusing the state's
increasingly
limited resources on only the most serious offenses.&nbsp; The result
has
been that the quality of life disputes have been ignored, the
confidence
of the public in the justice system have been eroded to abysmal levels,
and the anger at the failure of government to deliver the desired
outcomes
has resulted in increased punishment of&nbsp; the only scapegoats we
had.&nbsp;
Changing this model is a big job.&nbsp; It gives an opportunity for
citizens
to take a more active role in providing safety and justice in their own
neighborhoods than they have had in many decades.&nbsp; It also
requires
the current justice system to let go of old ways, and devolve power,
authority,
and&nbsp; responsibility to the community. Gorczyk believes it can be
done
beyond Vermont.&nbsp; If we are going to be serious about public safety
nationally, we need to get serious about community.&nbsp; We all
need&nbsp;
to -- the criminal justice system cannot do it alone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately,
market research by the DOC shows that the public wants to be involved
in
criminal justice.&nbsp; People want safety from violent predators,
accountability
for the violations of law, repair of the damage done and treatment to
assure
safe release -- with strong community participation in the process by
which
all this happens.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its most recent
thinking, the DOC has gone beyond reparative justice.&nbsp; John
Gorczyk
and his staff are now thinking of themselves as the "Department of
Cooperation".&nbsp;&nbsp;
Chapters 5 and 6 will reveal more about how this change is taking shape
as they build on their understanding of human nature.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BEYOND CRIME</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This chapter
has shown how to meet the prerequisite conditions for inducing balanced
and expanding reciprocity. It has demonstrated a process for detecting
breaches in reciprocity and healing them.&nbsp; The next chapters will
test ways of governing that provide the other three conditions
necessary
for inducing reciprocity that are at the core of natural democracy:
close
proximity between people, frequent opportunities for exchange of
favors,
and the value of the favor to the recipient being greater than the cost
to the giver of the favor.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Governance by
control of our genes is shaping up.&nbsp; Evolution has given us the
capability.&nbsp;
Now we are finding how to use it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There appear
to be grounds for optimism in what's been learned about criminal
justice.&nbsp;
Suppose I take the most upbeat view that I can imagine.&nbsp; Suppose I
assume we're not stuck with all the chaos and destruction that have
been
going on in the world for so many years.&nbsp; We can take
charge.&nbsp;
There is no genetic destiny holding this chaos in place.&nbsp; We know
the defining core of our existence.&nbsp; It is the set of epigenetic
rules
and emotions built by many years of biological trial and error.&nbsp;
At
any point in our lives, we can now set up systems that bring out our
natural
tendencies to cooperate and reciprocate.&nbsp; We can imagine extending
this process into our personal lives, helping our children to get the
most
out of life, and beyond that, making governance work for us to get
wherever
we want to go.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are making
progress in proving that human nature tells us much that might help us
choose a meaning for our lives.&nbsp; Maybe Homo Sapiens can settle
down
and be happy before we wreck the planet?&nbsp; How do I know it will
work
beyond the criminal area?&nbsp; Up ahead lies new territory.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The value of
the discoveries that are being made in these tests is that they seem to
give us predictive power that humanity has never had before.&nbsp; We
can
imagine a change we want to make.&nbsp; We can imagine a future we want
to have.&nbsp; We can get inside people's minds -- our own included --
to understand how people would respond to that change and that
future.&nbsp;
We can set up systems for relating to each other so that breaches in
reciprocity
don't occur; and if they do occur, they can be healed
effectively.&nbsp;
We can build into these systems the conditions for inducing
reciprocity.&nbsp;
We can build natural democracy with its governance of human nature.
