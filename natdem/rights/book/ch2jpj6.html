<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW TO DO SELF-PILOTING AND CONTROL
OUR GENES
</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My colleagues
and I are applying our understanding of how the genes get us into
trouble
and how our understanding of them can keep us out of trouble. We know
that
the central problem is that humanity is on automatic pilot too much of
the time. We know the solution is to move from automatic pilot to
self-control,
being conscious of how our genes are controlling us and how we can
control
them.
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Design Components of Natural Democracy</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; first
component of natural democracy is the epigenetic rules. The ways in
which
the influence of our genes become visible in humanity's behavior and
emotions
are the gene-based characteristics of human behavior and emotions.
These
characteristics were called "epigenetic rules", by E. O. Wilson and
Charles
Lumsden in their 1981 book titled, Genes, Mind, and Culture; the
Coevolutionary
Process. Rules, which are pertinent to natural democracy, include the
tendency
to reciprocate, to&nbsp; do things for others and return favors done
for
us. They also include the tendency to deceive others, and us many times
unconsciously. More complete details about these rules are described in
the Appendix.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second component
of natural democracy is to create conditions that induce our genes to
trigger
balanced and expanding reciprocity. In the human genome work reported
to
date, the gene mapping has found genes identified with a number of
behaviors
and emotions.&nbsp; So far most of them have been connected to
particular
diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's and Schizophrenia. However
it
is obvious that deception detection is a key condition for allowing
reciprocity
to function. Without the ability to detect deception, trust doesn't
develop
and exchanges of favors cease.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
third component of natural democracy is self-piloting, each person
being
conscious of human nature and taking it into account during the
governance
process. Self-piloting is the process by which each of us brings our
behavior
into consciousness, examining the impact of the rules on our situation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fourth component
is the development of great goals and measures of progress toward them.
Great goals are the visions of life outside of our own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In each of the
tests of natural governance described in subsequent chapters, all these
components, these design tools, were used.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These genes are
controlling all of us through a set of rules which define and guide how
we behave and express emotion. These rules have been programmed into
our
genes over millions of years as we have evolved. They evolved because
they
worked.&nbsp; The rules are tendencies to behave in certain ways when
we
are confronted with situations that are like similar situations in the
primitive environment.&nbsp; There are several rules.&nbsp; Most of the
time only one rule is controlling you at any instant. Which one is in
control
generally depends on what is going on around you, the conditions in
your
"environment" -- the immediate world of people and things around you
and
beyond you in the world.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my Vermont
Agency of Human Services colleagues and I want to understand what's
going
on in a situation, we take the rules into our consciousness one at a
time.&nbsp;
We find five rules to be sufficient most of the time to understand what
is going on: Reciprocity, Anxiety about Strangers, Two-part
Classification,
Deception, and No Integrated Assessment.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reciprocity:&nbsp;
Reciprocity is the natural human tendency to respond in kind to actions
of others.&nbsp; We tend to react toward others in the same way we are
acted upon. Those who do us ill are likely to be treated with similar
behavior.&nbsp;
When someone does something for us, we tend to feel a sense of
obligation
to respond with equivalent good.&nbsp; Reciprocity is the glue that
holds
human societies together at the most basic level. The frequent exchange
of favors is fundamental to social cohesion.&nbsp; The favors do not
have
to be large, and the most effective reciprocal exchanges occur when the
cost of the favor to the giver is less than the value to the
receiver.&nbsp;
For example, a neighbor volunteering to take care of a new baby allows
the new mother some respite.&nbsp; The new mother, somewhat refreshed,
can do a better job of caring for the baby.&nbsp; The neighbor may
benefit
by sleeping better if the baby&nbsp; doesn't cry as much at
night.&nbsp;
This one simple exchange of favors benefits the neighbor, the mother,
and
the baby.&nbsp; And it builds trust. Another example -- if I call the
fire
department because I see your house on fire while you are at work, it
costs
me little, but is very important to you.&nbsp; We both benefit, because
you will very likely return the favor if my house is on fire, but more
important, you will be more likely to call the fire department if you
see
smoke in a house across town, and, in the long run, all of our
insurance
rates will go down.&nbsp; The more favors we do for one another, the
closer
we become.&nbsp; Friendship is a direct corollary of the frequency and
intensity of favors exchanged.&nbsp; Love is the most intense form of
reciprocity
in human emotion.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another rule
is the Anxiety in the Presence of Strangers rule.&nbsp; All human
beings
feel anxious in the presence of strangers.&nbsp; They relax and feel
relief
when they are in a crowd and recognize someone.&nbsp; All human beings
become very anxious when they are alone, confronted with a group of
more
than two young, strange teenagers or young men.&nbsp; It doesn't take
much
to decrease the stranger anxiety -- a comment about the weather is
sufficient,
if responded in kind.&nbsp; "Hot, isn't it?"&nbsp; "Enough to fry an
egg!"&nbsp;
"Yep."&nbsp; Nevertheless, the stranger's rule is in operation with all
new people we meet.&nbsp; That is why diplomats exchange gifts and talk
about their children.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third effective
rule is Two-Part Classification, which defines the way in which humans
make decisions.&nbsp; We tend to divide all decisions into iterative
dichotomies
-- the part of the decision that is in, the part that is out.&nbsp;
Then
we take the part that is in, divide it in two, and so on.&nbsp; This is
a function of having to make choices about our environment
quickly.&nbsp;
If the jaguar drops down out of the tree, should I run or shout a
warning?&nbsp;
Should I dodge left or right?&nbsp; A series of binary choices gets us
to the most effective short-run strategies the fastest.&nbsp; This is
all
well and good when the choices are primitive. But when we combine
two-part
classification with the strangers rule, we sometimes get into serious
trouble
as in the Arab/ Israeli relationships, for example.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth rule
is Deception.&nbsp; In our political process, many of our national
leaders
have claimed to be in favor of campaign finance reform, but have found
circuitous ways of covering their tracks as they have paid back major
contributors
to their campaigns. We sometimes deceive ourselves and others about the
realities of the moment.&nbsp; We have to believe that we make a
difference,
and that what we do is important.&nbsp; We have to believe that we are
good people, in order to cope with the guilt of not being so
occasionally.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the
No Integrated Assessment rule.&nbsp; Human beings are so bound by the
epigenetic
tendencies that we function primarily on the influence of one rule at a
time.&nbsp; In fact, most of the rules are in operation (auto-pilot)
most
of the time, and we base our behavior and reactions on (usually) one
rule
at a time.&nbsp; Most decisions in the primitive environment were
life/death
choices. "The quick and the dead." However, most decisions we make in
the
modern era are far more complicated, and require, for effectiveness,
assessment
of the factors that influence the issue, including the perspective
resulting
from examining each issue with regard to the rules.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A breach in reciprocity
occurs when we do not have a sense of kinship, and then behave as if
the
stranger has done us wrong. Breaches in Reciprocity also occur when
the favor done is not returned or acknowledged.&nbsp; This occurs more
readily between people who do not see themselves as kin. Since most of
the world, and even the citizens of our hometown, are not direct kin to
us, reciprocity for kin's sake is difficult to come by.&nbsp; And since
we are not kin, it does not come naturally for us to sacrifice even a
little
for a stranger.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that
some of the conditions in our lives have caused and are still causing
humanity's
genes to trigger negative reciprocity, especially in the context of the
anonymity of the modern world.&nbsp; When we feel that another person
has
wronged us, it gives us permission to wrong them in return because they
are not known to us.&nbsp; An extreme example from the past is that the
conditions in WWII were such that the enemy and I exchanged bullets and
bombs in attempts to kill each other.&nbsp; And yet, even in the heat
of
the most negative reciprocal exchanges, human beings make amends, make
peace and make do.&nbsp; After the battle of Fredericksburg in the
American
Civil War, solders sent rafts across the Rappahannock River to one
another,
carrying coffee one way, tobacco the other.&nbsp; In World War I, the
trenches
would be quiet, and soldiers would carry on conversations and exchange
letters.&nbsp; We know, in general, that a key part of the solution is
to allow the conditions in our lives to become those that will cause
our
reconciliation genes to heal breaches.&nbsp; We make amends for the
wrongs
we do.&nbsp; Heads of state exchange gifts in face to face encounters,
in the same way that families send cards at birthdays to recognize
their
kinship.&nbsp; Humanity is probably designed to be able to change the
conditions
in our lives to produce and sustain natural democracy -- healing and
breaches
in reciprocity before they get out of control, as part of the process
of
natural democracy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consciously moving
to natural democracy is likely to require great amounts of political
will,
so substantial inducements may be needed.&nbsp; The democratically
developed
great goals mentioned in Chapter 1, and further developed in subsequent
chapters, are candidates to provide the motivation.&nbsp; Making
sustainable
progress toward the goal of becoming all we can be is likely to require
a more effective political process than democracy has yet produced
while
we have been still under automatic control.&nbsp; The present process
makes
it too easy to kill each other and waste energy in cleaning up the
messes
that war leaves.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, humanity's
design, our genetic design, our double helix DNA, gives us the
capability
to produce and sustain natural democracy and natural governance.&nbsp;
Before showing that capability in action, here is a list of the design
ingredients, the components that allow these forms of governance to
function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can taking
human nature into account change governance and democracy?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are three
steps.&nbsp; My colleagues and I learned these steps by running the
tests
of natural democracy reported in subsequent chapters.&nbsp; By
describing
the steps now, the logic of the test will be cleared.&nbsp; Also, it
will
demonstrate that you and every reader have both the capability and a
feasible
route to pilot yourself toward exciting great goals.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My colleagues
and I learned that the steps are synergistic. Each expand the
understandings
from others. As you go through this step yourself keep in mind that we
had two roles. One was to learn this steps as a technique for our own
personal
use, each getting our own answers to the "What do I want to do with
life?"
question. The other role was defined by our function in the Agency of
Human
Services: to help people answer that question for themselves. For
example,
to teach people how to decide to cooperate rather than steal, or how to
decide to participate effectively in their children's education at all
stages, or how to decide to live health-promoting lives. In those two
roles,
we proved to ourselves that each step has practical value.
&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1. Learn how to be conscious
of how our genes are controlling us.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep in mind
the image of a section of the human genome. (See P. 6B). Your body
contains
millions of times more sections of the genome than are shown in this
image.&nbsp;
They are in every cell in your body, including your brain. These genes
are controlling us through the epigenetic rules. When John Gorczyk, the
Commissioner of Corrections, wants to analyze any problem situation, he
brings these rules into his consciousness, one at a time.&nbsp; He
restates
the problem in terms of which rules are causing it.&nbsp; The solution
becomes obvious out of this process.&nbsp; He uses the tendencies
consciously
in his interactions with people.&nbsp; He determines which tendencies
are
controlling them and tailors his responses accordingly.&nbsp; He takes
the range of emotions into account as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Perry, Director
of Planning for the Department of Corrections has a list of the human
nature
tendencies posted on the wall in front of his desk.&nbsp; As he works
with
this understanding of human nature, he glances up from time to time to
bring them into whatever he is working on at the moment.&nbsp; He uses
the tendencies in stages -- first applying them, and then testing the
results,
then using them again to modify his results on the basis of the initial
feedback. In creating new programs, he is guided by the tendencies.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tests the
draft with focus groups.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gets feedback
about what is likely to work well.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He uses the
tendencies to predict what is not likely to work.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He says that
this understanding is so powerful that it has altered the way his brain
works, and he knows it works better.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe Patrissi,
the former commissioner, applies the tendencies in steps, first
"spotlighting"
-- shining each tendency like a spotlight to see what effect it has on
the problem. Next, he predicts what might resolve the problem, using
the
tendencies as guides to achieve the desired results.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the
problem of " the deadbeat dad", an absentee parent. The separation of
father
from child creates a breach in the reciprocity. In these situations Joe
and his people use their deeper understanding of human nature to make
the
possible consequences visible. They trace the series of breaches in
reciprocity,
which in many cases could lead to a prison term as the child grows into
a resentful youth.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracing the reciprocity
chain opens up thinking about the opportunities to create conditions
that
are likely to prevent the breaches from occurring in the first place.
It
opens up thinking about healing very minor breaches at the early stages
of growth beyond babyhood. For example, the community may have an
obligation
to the family to provide opportunities for successful parenting.&nbsp;
This may not be fully satisfied by paying taxes to support a school. It
probably requires mentoring and role modeling among and between
neighbors
and families.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gorczyk, Perry,
Patrissi, their colleagues, and I work as a team on occasions,&nbsp;
Sharing
our thoughts about which rules are controlling in a situation. We look
at the conditions that are causing the particular rules to be
controlling.&nbsp;
The Reciprocity rule turns out to be the one that gives us the most
insight
about what's going on, and breaches of it generally define the problem
to be addressed.&nbsp; As we apply the insights, my colleagues and I
have
learned that they answer two primary questions (from a rules
perspective):
What is going on?&nbsp; Why is it happening?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tests reported
in subsequent chapters show how conditions were changed to repair
breaches
in reciprocity.&nbsp; In each case, we started by identifying those
breaches.&nbsp;
So a good way to begin to become conscious of how your genes are
controlling
you is to think about the breaches of reciprocity, which you see around
you in the world, and the conditions that produced them.&nbsp; Example:
Our reliance on gasoline engines produces carcinogenic chemicals
creating
an overly stressed environment in the natural sense.&nbsp; Healing that
breach calls for a new balance in our reciprocal relationship with the
physical environment.&nbsp; Example: cleaner air and water to lower
health
hazards.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another breach
is apparent in the lack of citizen participation in government.&nbsp;
The
ultimate price we have been paying for lack of citizen participation
has
been war.&nbsp; With problems such as the overstressed environment and
war, we have been trapped by the epigenetic rule of no integrated
assessment.&nbsp;
Our governance processes have not been designed to adequately assess
the
potential future consequences of the interaction between these problems
and the problem of automatic control by our genes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another breach
is caused by the role of uncontrolled deception.&nbsp; In our political
process, many of our national legislators claim to be in favor of
campaign
finance reform, but then find circuitous ways of covering their tracks
as they pay back major contributors to their campaigns.&nbsp; This is
an
example of being controlled by the epigenetic rule of deception: our
tendency
to deceive others, and ourselves many times unconsciously.&nbsp; The
effects
of these two epigenetic rules, no integrated assessment and deception,
are closely related.&nbsp; The tendency not to make integrated
assessments
allows our legislators to deceive us because our political processes
are
not adequate designed to make the paybacks to major contributors
visible.
Without a more adequate understanding of human nature, we have a
tendency
not to dig deeply enough to realize the deceptions others are
committing
and their consequences.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three other epigenetic
rules referred to earlier are likely to cause breaches in reciprocity
in
today's world where unconscious control by our genes still holds
sway:&nbsp;
The Strangers Rule; the tendency to experience anxiety when we are
alone
in a first encounter with someone new and strange. The criminal justice
system has been dominated by unconscious control by the stranger's rule
and the breaches that were left unhealed as a consequence.&nbsp; A
second
rule: Two Part Classification; our tendency to sort into two
categories,
black/white, and kin/non-kin, in-group/out-group. Offenders were
regarded
as criminals rather than as young people who needed to be taught how to
cooperate.&nbsp;&nbsp; A third rule:&nbsp; Obedience to Authority;
challenging
a powerful leader was apt to be dangerous in ancient times.&nbsp; When
unconsciously carried over into today's world, several of our
legislators
go unchallenged even when obvious breaches in reciprocity are evidenced
by gross disregard of the public's wishes---disregard serious enough to
call for campaign finance reform, but still not serious enough for it
to
take effect.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insights on another
way you can become conscious of how your genes are controlling you have
been provided by Randolph Nesse of the Evolution and Human Adaptation
Program
at the University of Michigan.&nbsp; He points out that each of our
emotions
is aroused only in specific circumstances.&nbsp; A companion insight is
that each emotion is useful only in certain circumstances.&nbsp; Each
of
our emotions was designed into our genes to increase people's ability
to
cope with threats and opportunities under those circumstances.&nbsp;
Core
emotions on everybody's list are: fear, anger, happiness, sadness, and
love.&nbsp; Next time you become embarrassed, notice the specific
circumstances.&nbsp;
Did becoming embarrassed help you to deal with the situation?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your genes are
controlling you as you experience many emotions.&nbsp; Several of the
emotions
are listed on Page 96 of the Appendix. Emotions energize behavior which
in ancient times led to the survival of your ancestors.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Emotions
enhanced individual and group reproductive success.&nbsp;
Learning&nbsp;
to become conscious of how your emotions are controlling you can be
helped
by reviewing this list from time to time.&nbsp; As you do this, think
about
which ones are serving you as energizers that encourage you to take
action.
Examples: aroused, confident, concerned, curious, daring, eager,
exhilarated,
hopeful,-- the list goes on.&nbsp; Also, think about which ones
motivate
you to heal breaches in reciprocity.&nbsp; Examples: several of the
previous
examples, plus loving, touching, warm, secure, reconciling and even
guilty.&nbsp;
You will find that periodic review of this list will help you to become
more aware of their roles and effects.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other insights
about how your genes are controlling you have been provided by E.O.
Wilson.
He points out that our species has retained hereditary traits that add
greatly to our destructive impact on people and the physical world. He
holds humanity up to a mirror:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We
are tribal and aggressively territorial. We are oriented by selfish
sexual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and reproductive drives. Cooperation beyond the family and tribal
levels
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
comes hard. Individuals place themselves first, family second, tribe
third
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the rest of the world a distant fourth. Our genes predispose us to
plan
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ahead for one or two generations at most. We respond swiftly, and often
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ferociously, to slight challenges to our status and tribal security.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilson feels
that these traits call for a reconsideration of our self image as a
species.&nbsp;
The ethical issues these traits raise are so basic.&nbsp; They are
likely
to require some redirection of science and technology, subjects which
he
addresses in Consilience.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unconscious control
by our genes leaves us vulnerable to these negative traits and gets us
into trouble in today's world. That is the problem that natural
democracy
addresses. Defining it in this way sets the stage for the next step. In
Consilience, Wilson says there is no genetic destiny outside our free
will.
We must decide what we wish to become.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been through
this process of becoming conscious of how my genes are controlling
others
and me so many times that it has become second nature. I instantly
notice
which epigenetic rules are tending to control my and others behavior
and
feelings. I keep that image of the double helix DNA near the top of my
mind. In any situation, that image flashes up and I get an immediate
answer
to the question, "What is going on?" I've had so much experience in
answering
that question that I get several answers almost immediately --- which
epigenetic
rules are influencing my thoughts and behavior, which rules are
probably
influencing others' thoughts and behavior. There are feelings of
confidence
and ability to influence that come with this.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2. Learn how to decide how you
want your genes controlling you.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several
ways to help in this decision about how you want your genes controlling
you. One is to think about the personal choices you would like to be
able
to make, with more freedom to make them than you may have now.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of
the
voting technology described in Chapter 7 will disclose personal
priorities
as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop
into all I'm capable of being
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Achieve
high and joyous levels of creativity and intelligence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have
personal
control over my destiny
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have
adequate
systems for resolving human conflict
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a
longer productive life
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have
mental
and physical health
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have
highly
effective ways to share my thinking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conquer
the unknown
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maximize
my joy of shared experiences</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second way
to help in this decision is to think about the advantages of taking on
the responsibility for making that decision, --advantages for you and
all
of us -- our families, our friends, our community, our world.&nbsp; The
tests of natural democracy reported in Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 provide
clues to these possibilities:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * We'll be the ones to say what happens to us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * We'll avoid "Big Brother" and a planned, regimented
society.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * We'll be doing the things that give us pleasure.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * We'll personally develop faster into all we're capable
of being.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * We'll achieve exaltation from discovery, enthusiasm,
triumph, self-esteem, meaningfulness, love and belonging; we'll help
our
children to do the same.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * We'll have much greater educational opportunities and
opportunities for second and third careers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * We'll be better able to afford the kinds of material
things, experiences, and services that add to the quality of our lives.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * We'll be able to live much longer in full health and
vigor.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * We'll be making very important contributions to society
and we'll feel good about that.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third way is
to decide which epigenetic rules you want to allow control over
you.&nbsp;
The logic of this is that these rules are the genes' ways of
controlling
you.&nbsp; Several of these rules have been listed in the first section
of this chapter. The rule that has proven to be most helpful in
governance
is: Reciprocity: the Tendency to Reciprocate, to do things for each
other
and return favors done for us. You will want the Reciprocity rule
controlling
you as you learn how to participate in natural democracy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fourth way
is to choose which emotions you want controlling you. Feeling the way
you
want to feel is one of the essential freedoms of natural
democracy.&nbsp;
No one likes to be told how to feel; however, having decided to choose
reciprocity as the primary epigenetic rule controlling you, the
question
is which emotion or combination of emotions will help you to function
in
a reciprocal mode.&nbsp; The core emotions mentioned in Step 1 were
fear,
anger, happiness, sadness, and love.&nbsp; You are probably going to
find
yourself choosing to be controlled by all five of these at various
times
in natural democracy. You are likely to find that you will need fear
because
it will help you to keep in mind the dangers of terrorism and nuclear
weapons
in war.&nbsp; You will probably find that anger is going to be useful
as
a motivator.&nbsp; Current breaches in reciprocity that are likely to
ignite
the emotion of anger include crime and the abandonment of
children.&nbsp;
Happiness is going to be welcome as a reward for the progress you'll be
making toward great goals.&nbsp; Sadness will be needed also as a
motivator.&nbsp;
Sadness about the suffering of children will fuel several of the
decisions
to be made in natural governance and democracy.&nbsp; My colleagues in
the tests would tell you that love will be a necessity.&nbsp; It is the
key emotion for discovering opportunities for reciprocity.&nbsp; John
Gorczyk
and others show that it love brings about forgiveness and repentance.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fifth way is
to choose the great goals toward which you want to head.&nbsp; As we
were
conducting the Lexington test in 1975 (Chapter 5), we in the project
leadership
had in mind several candidates for great goals.&nbsp; We labeled our
list
"Draft of Excessively Presumptuous Statements of One Version of Great
Goals
of the Human Race".&nbsp; The memories of WWII were ringing in my ears
as I wrote.&nbsp; Here are some extracts.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assure that
the
human race survives.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrange for
participation in decision-making worldwide about goals and priorities
of
the human race.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design
institutions,
which will permit everyone to work cooperatively and synergistically
toward
their great goals.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise the
ability
to learn and understand; catalyze the&nbsp; development of conditions
that
will provide everyone with the means by which to substantially raise
his/her
own intelligence; provide the human race with opportunities to take
intelligent
actions; deal successfully with new and trying situations, to become
highly
educated, and to experience the restful satisfaction from altruistic
acts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make all
information
available instantly, on demand as desired, to every human being on
earth;
provide completely ubiquitous, worldwide communication.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring health
to the world; provide everyone with the choice of living vigorously
physically
and mentally.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promote
sustainable
development; save what remains of our biological and ecological wealth.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These seven goals
are possibilities, but you decide what great goals you think are most
important
for you, including some that may not be listed here.&nbsp; Then the
stage
is set for the next step in how for you to take control of how our
genes
are controlling us.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3.&nbsp; Learning how apply
the understanding to generate solutions.
</span><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining
chapters will map the routes toward natural governance and natural
democracy.&nbsp;
There are several options for how to help and lead in making progress
along
these routes.&nbsp; One is to serve as a consultant to organizations
that
will benefit from taking human nature into account.&nbsp; There are
several
types of organizations to choose from:&nbsp; town and state governments
and government agencies, for example.&nbsp; In this option, your tools
will be the understanding of human nature and the techniques for
switching
from autopilot to self-piloting.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many
other organizations to choose from in taking on the task of introducing
them to natural governance in order to better achieve their objectives.
The common denominator in each case is that the implicit objective of
the
organization is to heal breaches that hinder progress toward great
goals.
Working with any one of the organizations or with several concurrently,
you will probably find that, at first, they don't see their mission in
human nature terms.&nbsp; The word "implicit" is important because they
may not yet understand their objective in the way that is obvious to
you
with your understanding of human nature.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your understanding
prepares you to educate one or more of these organizations about how to
be conscious of how their genes are controlling them and the people
they
want to influence. Your understanding also prepares you to educate them
about how&nbsp; to decide how they would rather have their genes
controlling
them and the people they want to influence in order to heal breaches in
reciprocity, for example. Below is a list of typical organizations.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book provides
techniques available for you to help organizations, either as
consultants,
as members, or as outside observers or commentators on their
opportunities
for eliminating breaches in reciprocity.&nbsp; Whatever application you
choose will require your own special interpretation of the information
provided on natural governance and democracy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other organizations
that are working on healing breaches in governance processes as one of
their missions include the World Future Society, the National Peace
Foundation,&nbsp;
the American Humanist Association, Oxfam America, Union of Concerned
Scientists,
the National Wildlife Federation, the Center for Public Integrity, and
the EarthJustice Legal Defense Fund.&nbsp; They are working toward
great
goals, on their own terms.&nbsp; They, too, are largely unaware of the
opportunities to enhance their progress toward those goals through
natural
governance. Their progress is being inhibited by the autopiloting in
the
general population.&nbsp; Lack of integrated assessment is keeping
people
outside of each of these organizations from realizing the importance of
providing funding to support them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example of
these opportunities to use natural governance is to provide education
about
sustainable development.&nbsp; The United Nations Association, with
sustainability
as part of its mission, would have ready access to natural democracy's
decision-making processes at the local level, working globally through
a World Parliament network, which will be described in Chapter 7.&nbsp;
Probable issues would include development of solar power and expanding
use of the World Wide Web to save on energy consumption by reducing the
need to transport people.&nbsp; These issues would be added to local
governance
process agendas as people assume more of their share of the
responsibility
for the global environment.
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">READY FOR THE TESTS
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three steps
reported in this chapter provide the logic which we put to use in the
tests
of natural democracy. In reading the next chapters, you can use the
same
steps to help understand the process: first, be conscious of how your
genes
are controlling you and others; second, decide how you want your genes
to be controlling you and others; and third, help and lead in bringing
about natural governance and democracy.&nbsp; Now you are prepared to
judge
the potential of this fundamental change in how we humans think about
ourselves.
