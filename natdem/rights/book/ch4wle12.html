<span style="font-weight: bold;">USING&nbsp; OUR&nbsp; GENES&nbsp;
IN&nbsp; INDUSTRY&nbsp; AND&nbsp; EDUCATION</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective natural
democracy and natural governance will need the help of technology
designed
with human nature in mind. Industry can supply that technology.&nbsp;
These
new forms of governance will also require education that teaches young
people how to take control of how their genes control them instead of
not
being in control of how their genes are controlling them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; had an
opportunity to test natural governance at Polaroid Corporation from
both
the education and technology perspectives.&nbsp; Right after the
assassination
of&nbsp; Martin Luther King, Jr., I visited a public school in a black
neighborhood in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; I drove through riot-burned
neighborhoods,
smashed storefronts, with devastation everywhere.&nbsp; Then I came to
an oasis: a public school with classrooms filled with children who were
writing stories of what had happened.&nbsp; They had taken instant
pictures
with Polaroid cameras and were using them to help tell their stories.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came to the
desk of a girl who had a picture of herself with a bed sheet pulled up
above her nose with fear in her eyes.&nbsp; I asked if I could read
what
she was writing.&nbsp;&nbsp; She wrote that her mother had taken the
picture
after she had been out in the middle of the riot.&nbsp; She wrote about
how afraid she had felt.&nbsp; She had been to a candy store and was on
her way home when ( here I read), "I saw people with baseball bats
swinging
at store windows, fires starting everywhere, sirens were
screaming.&nbsp;
A big policeman came up to me.&nbsp; He said, "-- too dangerous for you
out here -- Where do you live?&nbsp; I'm going to take you home.""
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the next desk
a boy wrote how a policeman had helped him find his father in the
riots.
He wrote -- "My daddy said "What are you doing here?&nbsp; You go
home."&nbsp;
My daddy said, "This didn't need to happen if white folks had treated
black
folks better."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
girl was writing about how her teacher had helped her understand why it
was all happening.&nbsp; She had a picture of the teacher with her arm
around her.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those instant
pictures were used by the teachers to help the students enhance their
perception
of the social forces around them, to help bring meaning, allowing
faster
learning, bringing emotional strength, helping the students to share
their
feelings and whatever else was on their minds.&nbsp; Here was an
example
of technology that worked because it was consistent with natural
democracy.&nbsp;
In effect, these students were getting practice with the life-enhancing
epigenetic rules:&nbsp; the use of the instant pictures allowed
children
to make integrated assessments of the effects of the riots.&nbsp; They
could see commonalities between what they were learning and what was
happening
in the world outside the classroom. Their dialogue with their teachers
was enhanced as they shared their photographs in the classrooms. This
sharing
process increased the meaning of the events outside.&nbsp; While
understanding
what was going on, the children could gain a sense of competence and
control
over their lives.&nbsp; The caring of their teachers inspired the
students
to export this empathy into the community. Our technology had proven
its
increment of value again.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE&nbsp; INSPIRATION&nbsp;
FOR&nbsp; EMPHASIZING&nbsp; EDUCATION</span>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What had inspired
us to work toward getting our product into education?&nbsp; Several
months
before the riots, E. H. Land, president of Polaroid Corporation, came
back
from a high level meeting in Washington and told us that the country
was
about to explode over civil rights.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier in his
career, he had given a commencement address at the Massachusetts
Institute
of Technology.&nbsp; It was titled "On Entering&nbsp; the Majestic
Stage
of the American Revolution: An appeal for the engineering profession to
design a new kind of industry for people who vary in
abilities".&nbsp;&nbsp;
Land had tabulated what he called unifying noble purposes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sense deep human needs.</li>
  <li>Review engineering knowledge available to satisfy the needs.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Review known science that can be applied.</li>
  <li>See what gaps in science need filling.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve these
purposes, he pictured thousands of small organizations, each being
culturally
variant from the others, each its own experiment to answer such
questions
as: What is worth making? How should it be made? How should people
gather
together to make it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His questions
continued: "How are people to be involved in the research exploration
for
the product, and its design and manufacture?&nbsp; How can these
organizations
create a dynamic relationship among people -- people who have missions
-- so that people are always learning, always growing, steady with a
sense
of progress, warmly enthusiastic at participating in a future which
unfolds
day to day with rich intellectual and aesthetic rewards?"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Land was confident
that our nation was moving rapidly into the next great stage of the
American
revolution -- the stage in which Americans would be intellectually
alert,
incessantly creative, highly individualized and happily cooperative.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But along with
his confidence, Land was deeply troubled by what he saw going on&nbsp;
at that time in America.&nbsp; The disintegration of our cities, the
unemployment of our youth, the frustration of millions of citizens who
felt bored and ineffectual, by-products of the American dream, rather
than
the product.&nbsp; He saw two Americas and challenged us to take
action,
to be guided by the dream he had expressed at MIT.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this challenge,
we worked with him to envision two synergistic aims for all of us at
Polaroid.&nbsp;
Together, they defined the purpose of our company.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The First Aim
was to create products that help our customers and others (for example,
school children) become all that they could be. Land stated the first
aim
in this&nbsp; way: "to make products which are genuinely new and useful
to the public."&nbsp; He described it this way: "Each of us will have
the
satisfaction of helping&nbsp; to make a creative contribution to
society."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Second Aim
was to create relationships that encouraged everyone in Polaroid to
become
all that we could be.&nbsp; Land described it this way: "to give
everyone
working for Polaroid personal opportunity within the Company for full
exercise
of his or her talents, to express opinions, to share in the progress of
the Company as far as his or her capacities permit, to earn enough
money
so that the need for earning more will not always be the first thing on
our minds -- opportunity, in short, to make our work here a fully
rewarding,
important part of our lives."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Land described
the organization of worklife at Polaroid by what he called "the sun
satellite
principle."&nbsp; Each person in the organization acted as a sun of
creative
energy.&nbsp; At the same time, each person attracted satellites, other
fellow employees who could do more for each other and the company
through
their relationships with the other suns.&nbsp; Each person could do
more
than just being a sun.&nbsp; An example was how Polaroid developed the
color negative. It was an extremely complex task involving many people,
and was accomplished by using this organizing principle.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I look back
on this time, this was Land's and our way of living by natural
governance.&nbsp;
In effect, he and we had discovered ways of putting natural governance
to work in business. We had created the conditions that induced
reciprocity
within the company and between us and our customers. We hoped this
reciprocity
was radiating all over the world. Hopefully, as the seeds which we
planted
in children's education would sprout and help them later to use natural
governance in their communities.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me restate
the Two Aims in terms of this book:&nbsp; The First Aim is to create
products
that induce reciprocity and other life enhancing epigenetic rules and
emotions
in the world -- products that serve as tools for helping people to move
to self piloting.&nbsp; The Second Aim was to create conditions that
induce
reciprocity within a business organization, within industry -- to be
self
piloting partners in its success.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "sun satellite
principle" provided for close proximity in our working relationships
with
many opportunities to exchange favors.&nbsp; The benefits of the
exchanges
were always greater than the costs because the exchanges resulted in
products
that were in demand and earned a profit.&nbsp; Each employee received a
share of these profits that came naturally as the products induced
valuable
reciprocities.&nbsp; At Polaroid, we developed ways to both teach
reciprocity
through the use of our products in schools and encourage reciprocity's
spread in the world.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE&nbsp; SECRET&nbsp;
OF&nbsp; INSTANT&nbsp; PHOTOGRAPHY'S&nbsp; UNIQUENESS
</span><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We brought the
insights about human nature to the task of understanding what happens
when
an instant picture is taken. We studied the feelings and behavioral
differences
between what happens after a picture is taken with an instant camera,
compared
with what happens with a conventional camera.&nbsp; We realized that
what
people say and feel as they examine an instant picture which has just
been
taken of people, is likely to become associated with that picture in
both
the picture-taker's and the subjects' memories. For example, I take a
picture
of a woman. Then I truthfully say, as we look together at the finished
photograph, "What a wonderful picture of you!" That complement is
likely
to be relished again when the subject looks at her picture in future
times,
as happens with album-stored photographs. Technology has created an
increment
of appreciation which is there for a lifetime.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I labeled this
"context building", defined as causing emotions and behaviors to be
elicited
and building memory of them into the picture.&nbsp; A picture-taker who
makes use of this power of instant photographic technology has gained
an
increment of freedom in choosing which thoughts and emotions are likely
to be associated with photographs.
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">EXTENDING&nbsp;
CONTEXT&nbsp; BUILDING&nbsp; INTO&nbsp; OTHER&nbsp; SCHOOLS</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing instant
photography in the Washington, D.C. schools was the start of&nbsp; the
spread of context building in education.&nbsp;&nbsp; As previously
described,
the students took pictures of the riots.&nbsp; The deep emotions in the
riots were captured in the instant pictures.&nbsp; As the pictures were
brought back into the classrooms, the emotions in the imaging were
still
there to inspire the story writing by the students.&nbsp; When provided
with a camera, the students had built context naturally.&nbsp; Then the
words flowed freely on to paper.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All sorts of
reciprocal exchanges were taking place.&nbsp; The students were sharing
important stories with their classmates and the teachers.&nbsp; The
teachers
nurtured the story writing process by their questions.&nbsp; They even
nudged the corrections in grammar and spelling by pointing out the
importance
of having everybody in the school understand the stories.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I retired from Polaroid,
Maureen Harrington, my secretary for many years, took over the task of
spreading the use of instant photography in education.&nbsp; She loved
students and she loved teachers.&nbsp; In partnership with them, she
catalyzed
the development of curriculums that used instant imagery to reinforce
life
skills -- goal-setting, team-building, cooperative learning, conflict
resolution,
building the foundations of self esteem.&nbsp; Each student created a
personal
vision, a vision that incorporated positive values into a&nbsp;
personal
honor code and a set of expectations for how students would like to be
treated.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In making the
honor code, each student identifies qualities she or he admires and
aspires
to possess.&nbsp; The teacher encourages each student to select
significant
and important qualities for their own honor code.&nbsp; Then the
students
take turns photographing each other.&nbsp; Each picture-taker instructs
the fellow student to look the way she or he wants to look in their
photograph
after they have achieved the qualities they have selected to possess
and
become.&nbsp; Pride shows on each face.&nbsp; This picture was mounted
on the student's honor shield.&nbsp; Around the picture, the student
draws
and writes descriptions illustrating their goal attributes.&nbsp; For
example,
"I won't let anyone tell me I can't do something if I believe I
can."&nbsp;&nbsp;
These codes get posted and each student has a chance to say how they
are
doing in living by their honor code.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This honor code
encourages each student's efforts towards self piloting.&nbsp; And
teachers
who understand the conditions for inducing reciprocity can use both the
code and the conditions to mentor that progress.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maureen Harrington
and her former associate at Polaroid, Charles McCrea, are taking the
first
steps to teach about human nature at the college level at Lyndon State
College, one of the four state colleges in Vermont.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A full page ad
as a testimonial to the accomplishments of the National Endowment for
the
Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities showed a Polaroid
picture
of a young girl with a large grin. (It appeared in the News of the Week
Section of the July 18, 1999 Sunday edition of The New York Times.) Her
face was made up as a Halloween clown.&nbsp; The caption beside the
photograph
read, "Kids with this mug shot hardly ever get the other kind."&nbsp;
The
signers at the bottom of the testimonial were over 100 board chairs and
chief executive officers of major U.S. companies.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The message was
clear: combine the arts and the humanities to help students become all
they can be.&nbsp; Land, if he had lived a while longer, would have
felt
gratified about both the message and the photograph.&nbsp; E. O. Wilson
calls Natural Democracy a field manual for how to combine the arts and
the humanities in "practical" ways.&nbsp; This photograph illustrated
that
practicality.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So technology
can catalyze reciprocity.&nbsp; Technology can facilitate
learning.&nbsp;
Technology can induce self-piloting.&nbsp; Technology can help us to be
able to choose how our genes control us. Technology can be a major tool
for natural governance.
