<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">USING&nbsp; OUR&nbsp; GENES&nbsp;
IN&nbsp; COMMUNITY&nbsp; GOVERNANCE</span>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you
drive
into the town of Lexington, Massachusetts, a statue of a Lexington
minuteman
greets you.&nbsp; He is holding one of the muskets that started the
American
Revolution in 1775.&nbsp; Lexington was still a revolutionary place 200
years later, when the test of natural democracy reported in this
chapter
continued the revolution.&nbsp; Two hundred years after the battle of
Lexington,
the people of the town had a vision of doing more than celebrating an
historic
event but, rather, of making our vision of that event live in the
Lexington
of 1975.&nbsp; We developed a project that was funded by the National
Science
Foundation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the
beginning
of the project we townspeople invited Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas to come to Lexington to talk about obstacles that were getting
in the way of the original Lexington vision and what could be done to
rekindle
it.&nbsp; We said to him: the bicentennial of the Lexington battle that
started the American Revolution is coming up; what do you suggest as a
theme for the celebration.&nbsp; His answer was "Community".&nbsp; He
reminded
us of our Declaration of Independence and the creed that it&nbsp;
contains.&nbsp;
He pointed out that several states have preserved in their constitution
the right of revolution.&nbsp; He said the witch-hunt that followed
World
War II had made the word "revolution" almost subversive.&nbsp; He
challenged
us to become a more caring community, one that strengthens bonds
between
us.&nbsp; He proposed that we fight the obstacles that were getting in
the way of that caring.&nbsp; We could set an example because the eyes
of the world would be on us at that historic moment.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here was an
opportunity
to apply the understanding of humanity's problem and the solution: to
move
to self-piloting and take control of how our genes are controlling us.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that
challenge,
our Town Meeting dedicated itself to "continue to discover and apply
increasingly
effective ways for all of us to participate in the decision-making
which
affects our lives, and to extend this participation beyond the borders
of our town, our state, and our Country -- to preserve and expand the
practical
realities of our self-government bequeathed to us by those who fought
and
died for it 200 years ago."<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE&nbsp; OPPORTUNITY</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a meeting
to plan the bicentennial celebration, I said to the key leaders ,
"Where
do we want to go in our quest for community, in our participation in
governing
ourselves?"&nbsp; I prodded them with these questions: "What is
personal
fulfillment?&nbsp; What is the ultimate freedom?"&nbsp; With these
questions
in mind, we formed a committee of the Town Meeting Association to help
guide the town meeting's participation in the bicentennial events.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Living in
that
historic place, I recognized the obstacles getting in the way of people
in Lexington and the United States that are still getting in the way of
the vision that had been on Lexingtonians minds back in 1775.&nbsp;
That
vision was governance by self-piloting: self-governance, natural
democracy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were
sensitized
to one obstacle to achieving that vision in today's world: It now is
requiring
more and more expertise to make sense of current, intricate
problems.&nbsp;
It is difficult for the ordinary citizen to get enough pertinent
information
to participate meaningfully in the political process.&nbsp; There has
been
a wholesale turning over of responsibility to government.&nbsp; The
town
meeting process of revolutionary times in the American colonies is now
relatively rare across the United States.&nbsp; Can the governance
process
be redesigned for today's world to take back that responsibility?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reminded the
committee that Thomas Jefferson had called the New England Town Meeting
"the wisest invention ever devised for the perfect exercise of
self-government,
giving to every citizen, personally, a part in the administration of
public
affairs."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee
read through the town clerk's records to learn what was on people's
minds
at that revolutionary time.&nbsp; We discovered that town meetings took
up issues far beyond the borders of the town.&nbsp; Between 1765 and
the
start of the Revolution, the meeting voted not to use tea until the
British
duty was repealed.&nbsp; This was the tax on tea that later
precipitated
the "Boston Tea Party".&nbsp; The meeting also voted to adhere to the
resolves
of the Continental Congress "to resist the unparalleled usurpation of
unconstitutional
power" by the British Parliament.&nbsp; They voted to support Boston's
boycott of stamped goods.&nbsp; They chose a "Committee of
Correspondence"
to address regional issues.&nbsp; Our townspeople took charge of their
own lives and challenged "the divine right of kings".&nbsp; They
discovered
a dignity among themselves that King George III did not
understand.&nbsp;
They were learning to trust themselves and their own judgments about
where
they wanted to go and what they wanted to happen.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MEETINGS&nbsp; FROM&nbsp; 1775&nbsp;
TO&nbsp; 1975</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee
compared
modern town meetings to those first meetings two centuries
earlier.&nbsp;
We noted the positive changes, including the expansion of liberties
which
included the right of women to participate and vote, the abolition of
slavery,
and the granting of civil rights.&nbsp; Our report went on to describe
other changes, however, which have been negative:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atrophication
has occurred in the following rights and liberties:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In 1775, each citizen went to Town
Meeting, and spoke if he wanted, and voted.Now, about 200
elected Town Meeting members each represent about 165 people. That
means that
nearly 30,000 citizens do not get to speak at Town meeting.&nbsp;
Communication
between each Town Meeting member and their constituents is sporadic.
Although
unintentional, this results in&nbsp; some degree of
"disenfranchisement".&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Two hundred years ago, it was common
practice to "instruct our representatives" to vote a certain
way on specific issues.&nbsp; Town Meeting appointed representatives to
multi-town regional
meetings.&nbsp; The people of the community debated on the floor of
Town Meeting
how these representatives should be "instructed and directed to vote".
  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This type of
instruction has since died out.&nbsp; The atrophication has been
two-fold:
first, in the deliberative dialogue that occurred on each issue.&nbsp;
The citizens at the meeting needed to talk each issue through to
understand
how it affected them and decide what they wanted their representatives
to do about it.&nbsp; Today, we are missing much of this deliberative
dialogue
on the issues of concern to most people.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second
piece
of atrophication shows up in the reluctance of present Town Meetings to
debate issues of regional, state, or national importance.&nbsp; The
1765-1780
Town records show many regional, state and "national" issues being
acted
on. Today this is a rare event.&nbsp; (The following note will be
transferred
to a section at the end of this book titled NOTES: As a footnote:&nbsp;
Ref. TOWN MEETING, Its Impact on April 19, 1775 and Beyond,
Participatory
Government in Action; Its Present and Its Future.&nbsp; Researched and
Compiled by the Commemorate Town Meeting Committee of the Lexington
Town
Meeting Members Association)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a central
part of the be-centennial celebration, Town Meeting Moderator Robert
Kent
gave a keynote presentation on "The Institution of Town Meeting in
Lexington".&nbsp;
He challenged the meeting to "share the passion and action of its
time."&nbsp;
He suggested that this town meeting "not try to avoid the terrible
problems
facing Boston, the country , the world.&nbsp; These are our problems,
as
they were recognized to be 200 years ago.&nbsp; Our relationship to
these
problems should be discussed in this place."&nbsp; This last thought
was
reinforced as part of a rededication of Lexington Common (Battle
Green):&nbsp;
"We pledge ourselves to recognize the worldwide interdependence of all
nations and to progress toward a united world."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We in the
project
leadership recognized that we needed to create goals that were greater
than the boundaries of the issues traditionally taken up at Town
Meeting.
We distributed questionnaires to the townspeople of Lexington, to
determine
what they cared about most deeply.&nbsp; They answered that they wanted
to have personal control of their destiny, to have highly effective
ways
by which we can share whatever is on our minds, and to have the
opportunity
to develop into all we are capable of being.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had in
mind
several great goals.&nbsp; The memories of W.W.II were ringing in my
ears
as we wrote them.&nbsp; We labeled our list "Draft of Excessively
Presumptuous
Statements of One Version of Great Goals of the Human Race". <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assure that the human race survives.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Arrange for universal participation in decision-making worldwide
about goals and priorities of the human race.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Design institutions which permit everyone to work cooperatively
and synergistically toward their great goals.</li>
  <li>Raise the ability to learn and understand.</li>
  <li>Catalyze the development of conditions to provide everyone with
the means to substantially raise his/her own intelligence</li>
  <li>Provide the human race with opportunities to take intelligent
actions; deal successfully with new and trying situations, to become
highly educated, and to experience the restful satisfaction from
altruistic acts.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Make all information available instantly, on demand as desired,
to every human being on earth; provide ubiquitous, worldwide
communication.</li>
  <li>Bring health to the world; provide the choice of living
vigorously physically and mentally.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Promote sustainable development.</li>
  <li>Preserve our biological and ecological wealth.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the
goals we decided on.&nbsp; You can decide what great goals you
think are most important, including some that are not listed here.
Setting these goals
prepares the stage for the next step in how to take control of how
our genes are
controlling us. Now the question for this test of natural democracy
was, "Will it allow us
to make important contributions to society and feel good about that?"<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">QUESTIONS&nbsp; WE&nbsp; SET&nbsp;
OUT&nbsp; TO&nbsp; ANSWER&nbsp;
IN&nbsp; TESTING&nbsp; SELF&nbsp; GOVERNANCE
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span>Can the New England
town meeting process take on regional, state,
national and global issues and problems?&nbsp; Can it influence them at
higher levels?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Is that system capable of involving a whole community -- every
segment, every age group every individual?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Does the use of natural governance principles in an
expanded&nbsp;
town meeting process provide an opportunity for women to take more
influential
roles in democracy?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Can these town meetings be guided by an understanding of human
nature and our genes? Can an understanding of human nature and our
genes
provide unique insights which make more effective solutions possible?
Will
these insights be truly revealing and life changing?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Can the town meeting process be enhanced to provide the
conditions that induce sufficient reciprocity to accomplish the above
listed
tasks?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Will the process allow us to make significant progress
in solving humanity's basic problem: unconscious control by our genes?
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPLICATIONS&nbsp;
FROM&nbsp; THE&nbsp; INITIAL&nbsp; PART&nbsp; OF&nbsp; THIS&nbsp; TEST</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I
started
this series of tests of natural democracy, I predicted that each test
would
add confidence in our ability to define humanity's central problem and
its solution, as suggested in Chapters 1 and 2.&nbsp; Back in 1775,
Lexington
was struggling toward self-piloting.&nbsp; The evidence we had examined
showed that the town meeting process of that time produced conditions
that
induced reciprocity.&nbsp; That reciprocity united Lexingtonians in
their
drive toward liberty, the great goal of freedom.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lexington
town
meetings of that 1765-1780 period took on a most crucial problem:
restriction
of liberty.&nbsp; They influenced the solution of that problem in a
most
resounding way: with revolution.&nbsp; This test of Town Meeting in
1975
had addressed and answered key questions: Is the town meeting process
strong
enough to take on regional, state, national, and global issues and
problems?&nbsp;
Can it effectively take on the important issues at these levels and
influence
them?
&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE&nbsp;
NEXT&nbsp; STAGE:&nbsp; IMPLEMENTING&nbsp; NATURAL&nbsp; DEMOCRACY</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During its
bicentennial
celebration, Lexington challenged itself to address and help solve
problems
facing our community, the Boston area, the United States, and the
world.&nbsp;
We answered that challenge by catalyzing a series of special town
meetings
to face up to these problems.&nbsp; Could a "more perfect" form of
natural
governance evolving from such a series help the town to do its share to
solve them?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In human
nature
terms, one of our tasks in this series was to create a process that
would
identify breaches in reciprocity, initiate action to heal the breaches,
and maximize positive reciprocity as the breaches were being healed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to this
stage of the test, the Town Meeting Members Association had developed a
set of procedures we now put to use.&nbsp; One was to create
sub-committees
to gather information on subjects to be voted on.&nbsp; Another was a
series
of preparatory sessions attended by all town meeting members to study
and
discuss the information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Association
asked that this next part of the test focus attention on a longer range
time span not readily used during regular town meetings.&nbsp; This
provided
the authority to experiment with procedures that would address the
basic
causes of breaches in reciprocity and fundamental changes that would
help
to eliminate the causes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started
this
process by setting up an Advisory Board with representation from the
Lexington
Board of Selectmen, the local Chapter of the American Association of
Retired
People, the John F. Kennedy Library, the League of Women Voters, the
Board
of Health, the Senior Citizens' club, the Middlesex Community College,
the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, the Intercommunity
Retirement
Board, The Polaroid Medical Department, the Human Services Council, the
Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical School, the Housing Authority,
the Council on Aging and the Town Manager's Office.&nbsp; This created
the first condition necessary for inducing reciprocity in the Special
Town
Meetings: close proximity of people representing the spectrum of
community
concerns.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With guidance
from the Advisory Board, we established sub-committees on Retirement,
Health
Legislation, Health Finance, Ethical Issues, and Human Services.&nbsp;
Their purpose was to develop articles to be voted on at the special
town
meetings.&nbsp; All five subcommittees participated in the development
of an article on funding for research on aging.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Retirement
subcommittee developed information on flexible retirement policies,
congregate
housing, senior part-time work programs and drug reaction in elderly.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Health
Legislation
subcommittee developed information on programs on health and nutrition,
a Lexington community health committee, mental health workshops and
programs
on coping with aging.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Health
Finance
subcommittee developed information on reform of Medicare, financial aid
for catastrophic illness and long-term nursing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ethics
subcommittee
focused on the ethical issues involved in several key warrant articles
including extending the healthy years of life, a high school course on
aging and increased training for health professionals on the subject of
aging.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Human
Services
subcommittee focused on Medicare reform, elimination of the tobacco
subsidy,
gerontologic medicine, public participation in medical research
priorities,
and intra-town public transportation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information
about
these Articles was then distributed to prospective participants well in
advance of the meetings. We had confidence they would read the
information
because, through discussion with the Advisory Board people in their
respective
organizations, they had already invested substantial time and meaning
in
the goal of extending the healthy middle years of life.&nbsp; There was
enough emotional commitment to activate the time-consuming task of
reading
the distributed material.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To
demonstrate
how these important issues can be addressed at the local level, I will
focus on the Article for research on aging to extend the healthy years
of life, for the remainder of the report.&nbsp; It is important that
concern
for all of the above issues develop locally in this multiissue process
in order to get broad national political support.&nbsp; By the nature
of
the comprehensiveness of this expanded town meeting process, advocates
for each issue find themselves supporting other issues as a way of
getting
more backing for their own.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the
other
issues that surface in a town meeting series are closely tied to the
larger
issues, and can be addressed more productively if those issues provide
a vision and rationale for action on the usual town meeting
issues.&nbsp;
All issues need to be addressed concurrently so that the necessary
political
support will develop from the synergism among the issues that was made
obvious by the meeting's comprehensive agenda
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each
subcommittee
developed a set of questions for discussion in the debate: What would
be
the social and scientific consequences of discoveries effectively
increasing
the length of life?&nbsp; How can citizens have input into the
priorities
of national budgets, such as the NIH?&nbsp; Should we also support
research
on psychological processes to combat depression?&nbsp; Are there enough
trained research workers to use additional funds properly? <br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">INPUT&nbsp; ON&nbsp; AGING&nbsp;
FROM&nbsp; RESOURCE&nbsp; PEOPLE
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the
special
Town Meeting sessions had experts present as resource people in the
debates.&nbsp;
At the Meeting on aging these included:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Chief of Section on Bio-medical Gerontology, Department of
Biochemistry,
Boston University School of Medicine,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Director, Gerontology Research Center and Science Director,
National
Institute of Aging,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Director of Social Gerontological Research, Hebrew Rehabilitation
Center
for Aged,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Professors from Harvard Divinity School, Harvard School of Public
Heath,
and Harvard Medical School,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a Coordinator on Gerontology, Middlesex Community College; a Senior
Editor,
the Hastings Center,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a Science Editor and author of the book "PROLONGEVITY", a report on the
scientific discoveries being made about aging and their promise of
extending
the human life span.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Town
Meeting
sessions also had input from the then Director of the National
Institute
on Aging, Dr. Robert N. Butler, who reminded us of&nbsp; "our ignorance
of what aging is -- an ignorance made the more profound by our societal
resistance to acknowledge the fact of aging and preparing adequately
for
it."
&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here is a sampling of the insights that these experts provided:
</p>
<p>From Dr. Richard C. Greulich, Director, Gerontology Research Center
and Science Director, National Institute of Aging:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The greatest share of our current
effort
in the National Institute of Aging relates to gaining
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a better understanding of the human
aging process.&nbsp; From this effort must inevitably
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come some major advances leading to
increased average life expectancy or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; significant extension of the human life
span."
</p>
<p>From Dr. Robert M. Veach, Senior Editor, The Hastings Center:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prevention of pain, suffering, and
long periods of debilitation, and the delaying of death are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; legitimate public policy
objectives.
Medical conditions that produce the greatest suffering
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be given priority."
</p>
<p>From Albert Rosenfeld, author of Prolongevity, a report on the
scientific
discoveries now being made about extending the human life span:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps now the probability of being
able to provide the choice of extending the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; healthy middle years of life is
high enough that we should plan on it. Why not take up,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with some anticipatory
exhilaration,
the challenge of pursuing whatever path may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bring us to our full humanhood?
-- to go on learning new skills, new sports, new
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relationships -- to read
everything
you want to read -- to listen to all the music -- to savor
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and resavor experience and arrive
not at boredom, but at new levels of appreciation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be around long enough to use
your talents to make important contributions to the world."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This part of
the test was directed at overcoming the epigenetic tendency not to make
integrated assessments, even on serious life issues.&nbsp; We made sure
that objective, well founded, broadly-based information was available
to
the voters.
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
INFORMATION&nbsp; DEVELOPED&nbsp; BY&nbsp; SUBCOMMITTEES</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the
subcommittees
provided charts showing the present situation on the human aging
process
and related goals which more research could help to meet.
</p>
<p>The charts contrasted the negatives in the present situation: <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the early and middle stages
of life: tax burden for medical services to older
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people
and concern for an aging parent.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the later stages of life:
forced
retirement, low income, boredom, depression,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
disability;
decreased mobility, increase in frustration, large loss of human
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; potential,
widowhood, loss of wisdom and experience that older people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could
bring to young people.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The charts also showed the positives of reaching the goal of extending
life for each
<br>
segment of the community <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the young: more
help in growing into all they are capable of being, expanding
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
opportunities for careers and service.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the middle aged:
reduced anxiety about aging parents, encouragement
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to consider other occupations.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For older people:
good heath in those years, ability to work longer if desired, more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
adequate income, feelings of usefulness, continuing engagement in
meaningful
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
activity, companionship of spouse, continued learning, the opportunity
to make
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
major contributions to the world, new levels of appreciation, fewer
constraints
on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
freedom of choice.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following
article on aging was proposed by the sub-committees:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "WE REQUEST
OUR
FEDERAL LEGISLATORS TO PROVIDE
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUBSTANTIAL
INCREASES IN FUNDING FOR BASIC BIO-MEDICAL
<br>

<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE HEALTHY
YEARS OF LIFE AND RESEARCH ON THE AGING
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROCESS."
&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">OTHER&nbsp; INFORMATION&nbsp;
PROVIDED&nbsp; BEFORE&nbsp; VOTING</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Health
Finance
subcommittee added its rationale for funding research on aging:&nbsp;
Our
best hope for our financial future lies in understanding the disease
processes
and preventing them.&nbsp; Even if the cost of this research adds to
our
taxes now, it will hold down costs in the future. It seems obvious that
the best attack on the problem of escalating costs is to invest more
now
in the attack on aging.&nbsp; With an expanding elderly&nbsp;&nbsp;
population,
medical expenditures increase disproportionately.&nbsp; The only
recourse
is more effective prevention and treatment of illnesses associated with
aging.&nbsp; It made sense to increase the total Institutes' budget
because
work is going on throughout the NIH which will impact on extending the
healthy years of life.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ethics
Sub-committee
developed guidelines for choosing among life-extending technologies,
pertinent
to extending the healthy middle years of life: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The younger
the individual, the greater should be the priority for life-extending
technologies.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Disease conditions
that produce the greatest suffering should be given priority.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>A medical
condition that is seen as involuntary, with causes outside the control
of the individual, have priority over conditions which have resulted
from
voluntary risky behaviors and life-style. The meetings took this
principle
into account in the resolution on public health costs caused by people
choosing to continue smoking, with its strong potential for becoming a
breach in reciprocity.&nbsp; Without these guidelines, the arguments
against
smoking would probably have been less persuasive.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Ethics Sub-committee raised these concerns: <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering
the problems of pollution, over-population, and diminishing resources,
is it morally right to extend life and thus aggravate our problems? <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young people,
even those who love and respect their elders, look to the day when
these
elders will step down from their positions, retire from active
competition,
die.&nbsp; They wait their turn for jobs, status, inheritance.&nbsp; Is
it morally right to deny this through prolongevity?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE&nbsp; FINAL&nbsp; ARTICLE</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The article
on
funding for research on aging was brought up in all the sessions of the
series to give opportunities for modification.&nbsp; After all sessions
had their say, the article took this final form:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That this meeting recommends substantial increases in funding for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bio-medical, clinical, behavioral and interdisciplinary research
throughout
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the National Institutes of Health
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That the aim of this research should be the extension of the healthy
years
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of life, and that additional support be provided for research on
special
and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
chronic diseases of the aged population.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That this meeting requests our United States senators and our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
representatives in congress to initiate legislation which will provide
for a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
15 percent increase in National Institutes of Health budget each year
for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the next four years.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A related
article
contained a clause requesting our senators and representative to
encourage
the National Institute of Aging to set up a liaison with communities so
they could pass along evidence of public support for research on aging
and rationale for it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was
plenty
of give and take on the article.&nbsp; At the session held in the High
School Auditorium, with many students in attendance, several students
objected
to this increase.&nbsp; Their argument was that the money ought to be
going
instead to help with current, pressing problems.&nbsp; Poverty!&nbsp;
Low
quality education in the inner cities!&nbsp; It was obvious that some
weren't
ready to think about the middle and later years of their own lives.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Articles on the following
issues for action on the Federal level passed unanimously: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comprehensive reform
of Medicare.</li>
  <li>Financial alleviation
of problems of catastrophic illness and long-term nursing care.</li>
  <li>Funding increase
for research on pharmacology and training of medical professionals
on the effects of drug interactions.</li>
  <li>Disapproval of subsidy
for growing tobacco, the use of which results in higher health
care costs.
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other action
affecting
the local community level passed unanimously, including resolutions
requesting
action on retirement policy and age discrimination, community nutrition
education, intra-town public transportation, mental health education,
senior
job bank and public school education on health and nutrition for
adults.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each voter
completed
a questionnaire at the end of each session. On the average, 89% agreed
that "More Money Should Be Spent on Research to Extend the Healthy
Middle
Years of Life".&nbsp; Over 98% agreed that "Young People Should Be
Given
the Opportunity to Benefit More From the Wisdom and Experience of
People
Over 65".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was
strong
agreement that "The social consequences of effectively increasing the
length
of life would be mostly beneficial."&nbsp; Another agreement was that:
"There should be ways to make it more evident to young people that what
they do today will affect their lives later and that good health from
childhood
on is more beneficial than doctoring in later years because of poor
care
in youth."</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE SUMMARY REPORT</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Summary
Report
to the National Science Foundation stated: "This experiment proved that
the Town Meeting format can be successfully applied to the task of
supplying
information for decisions about life and death matters.&nbsp; Experts
can
make substantial contributions to an entire community which then votes
to instruct its local officials and congressional representative to
take
action on allocation of resources for the long-range benefit of the
entire
community.&nbsp; Since the public policy issues are basic ones, and
since
the whole community can be involved in the deliberative process, these
public decisions made in the sessions are likely to be typical of those
that would be made in most communities in the United States."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report
went
on:&nbsp; "The Lexington formula could be modified for use throughout
the
United States--according to regional governmental traditions.&nbsp;
This
could be an important step in the direction of allowing citizens input
into the priority setting process of our democracy, where special
interests,
in many instances, now dominate."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator
Edward
M. Kennedy's reaction was typical of the commitment of all the senators
and representatives who were provided with information on our special
town
meetings and the decisions made.&nbsp; He said he was ready and willing
to cooperate on resolutions developed in such a comprehensive manner
with
participation by the whole community.&nbsp; This gave me hope that the
U.S.Congress is prepared by both design and inclination to take part in
natural democracy. Subsequent chapters will address how this
inclination
can come to fruition.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">TAKING&nbsp; HUMAN&nbsp; NATURE&nbsp;
INTO&nbsp; ACCOUNT
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
preceding
sections, several examples have been given showing how some of us made
use of the information about human nature in Chapters 1 and 2. Only a
few
of the participants had read Wilson's SOCIOBIOLOGY and ON HUMAN
NATURE.&nbsp;
GENES, MIND, AND CULTURE was yet to be written by Lumsden and
Wilson.&nbsp;
But the seed ideas had been planted in several of us. .
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did this
experiment show about how to take human nature into account?&nbsp; How
can we say that these meetings were natural democracy in action?&nbsp;
What were the characteristics of this town meeting process that induced
reciprocity?&nbsp; How did the evolution-based understanding of human
nature
and our genes help us to do what we did?&nbsp; What does all this show
about what to do next to overcome some of the remaining limitations of
our democracy?&nbsp; How did living through this experience move the
participants
along from automatic control by the epigenetic rules toward conscious
control
of these rules of human nature?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we had
proved
what we set out to prove.&nbsp; The town meeting process had been
competent
enough to take on regional, state, and national issues and problems
(because
it is based on expanding reciprocity and healing breaches in
reciprocity).&nbsp;
The process is capable of involving a whole community, every segment
and
every age group.&nbsp; The process allows the community to address
complex
problems in integrated ways which include scientific information
essential
to their solutions.&nbsp; The process enlists help from state and
national
organizations as it develops these solutions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, town
meetings
can be guided by an understanding of human nature.&nbsp; The leadership
of our special town meetings had provided the conditions that had
induced
more reciprocity.&nbsp; We had opened up several underutilized
opportunities
for taking advantage of this characteristic of human nature.&nbsp; For
example, by learning about aging, the young people discovered
opportunities
for dialogue with older people who have the wisdom to mentor them
toward
exciting careers beyond their dreams. As another example, the breach in
reciprocity by so-called second-hand smoking became more visible.
Smokers
are not doing a favor for those around them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.O. Wilson
has
since proposed that every student should be able to answer the
following
question: what is the relation between science and the humanities, and
how is it important to human welfare?&nbsp; What we had done in these
meetings
was to make the connection in the students' minds between the science
of
biology (the science of human aging) and the humanities (the social
effects
of aging) and the importance of that connection in every resolution
that
was passed --- the exchange of knowledge between the two branches of
learning
in a political process that provides the conditions that encourage that
exchange.
<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NATURAL DEMOCRACY IN ACTION</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we
say
that these meetings were natural democracy in action?<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The subjects were naturally on the minds
of at least some of the participants.&nbsp; Given the structure of the
more adequate political process, the subjects sprang up naturally out
of
people's present needs and future hopes.&nbsp; The construction of the
comprehensive agenda by several subcommittees in advance of the
meetings
provided the opportunity to have these subjects considered.</li>
  <li>The conditions of the exchanges were those
that naturally induce reciprocity.&nbsp; There was face to face close
proximity.
There were multiple and frequent opportunities for participants to do
favors
for each other.&nbsp; The benefits to the recipients of the favors
outweighing
the cost to the doers of the favors.&nbsp; The town meeting process
prevented
cheating by using techniques that detected any attempts to propose
measures
that would lead to breaches in reciprocity.</li>
  <li>The articulation of goals struck responsive
chords, because the goals had a solid foundation of realistically
achievable
reciprocity.</li>
  <li>Because the process had been agreed on face
to face, there was sincere, honest exchange of what was on people's
minds,
with the patience to listen.</li>
  <li>Because there was some benefit for everyone
in some aspect of each article, the subjects turned out to be of
interest
to everyone ---- each person knew that her or his favorite issue would
have its turn, an arrangement carefully crafted well in advance.</li>
  <li>The articles were addressed to people who had been
elected by the people making the requests.&nbsp; These representatives
were articulate in their dedication to serving their
constituents.&nbsp;
This willingness came naturally because these representatives, with
their
carefully honed political minds, could see the balanced reciprocity in
the requests.</li>
  <li>The people who were informed on each particular
subject were sharing their knowledge out of goodwill and the
willingness
to help, and the reciprocity was obvious.&nbsp; In giving their
knowledge,
these resource people had the satisfaction of being appreciated while
knowing
that the actions they were encouraging would aid them in accomplishing
a central part of their life's work.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These seven
statements,
in effect, describe principles of natural democracy.
<br>
In this test, we felt we had demonstrated how to overcome one of
humanity's
problems pointed out by Wilson: "Cooperation beyond the family and
tribal
levels comes hard."
<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">STILL A WAYS TO GO</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a few of
the leaders of these meetings were consciously aware of the
evolution-based
understanding of human nature and the control by the double helix,
DNA.&nbsp;
These few were able to help devise the right conditions so that the
participants
were being controlled mainly by the reciprocity epigenetic rule.&nbsp;
By being conscious of how our genes control us, we leaders had learned
how to decide how we wanted our genes to be controlling us in natural
democracy,
and we had implemented that decision.&nbsp; In order for the momentum
that
had been built up in these meetings to be fully sustained, I felt that
it would be necessary to educate the whole town in an understanding of
human nature. Education is always a necessary step toward the goal of
more
natural democracy, but it was obvious that there had to be intermediate
steps first, as Chapters 6 and 7 will show.
