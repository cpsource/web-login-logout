<span style="font-weight: bold;">USING OUR GENES IN STATE AND NATIONAL
GOVERNANCE</span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this
point,
my colleagues and I were encouraged to hope that natural democracy
could be a process for society to reach whatever goals it chooses.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
next
step we decided to take was to run another experiment in
Vermont. We noted that there was still a ways to go toward a full
expression
of natural
democracy. For example, state governments were not necessarily ready
to cooperate
effectively with local governments, even when a local government had
the experience to
exercise the principles of natural governance as Lexington did. .
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The uses of natural governance at the state
level are visible when comparing
the goals for partnerships between Vermont state government and local
communities with
typical state-local relationships:

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Derek Bok,
former
President of Harvard, described the fundamental problem underlying the
conditions listed in the left hand column.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According
to Bok,<br>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "democracy in
America finds itself at a critical juncture.&nbsp; Voters are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acquiring more
and more influence while paying less and less attention to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public
affairs.&nbsp;
This is a trend that bodes no good for the country.&nbsp; Most of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the things
Americans
like least about politics and government are linked to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public apathy
and alienation.&nbsp; Conversely, few of the reforms that would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help make
government
function better will come about without more active
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and informed
citizen participation. No easy remedies or institutional fixes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will cure our
discontents as long as so many citizens look upon the State
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; merely as an
entity to supply them with services in return for paying taxes."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bok
emphasizes
two worrisome trends involving serious paradoxes: Americans want to
gain
more power over their government but are devoting less time to exerting
a constructive influence.&nbsp; Their dissatisfaction with government
is
growing as their participation in the political process is declining.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vermont
partnership
challenges this trend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The characteristics and goals
in the right hand column are beacons guiding community and state
leaders.&nbsp;
Success is measured by both progress toward them and achievement of
them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most
useful
tools for reaching our great goals and for catalyzing natural
governance
at state, national, and global levels, were described in Chapter 2 as
the
design components of natural democracy.&nbsp; A major emphasis of that
chapter is creating in governance the conditions that induce our genes
to trigger balanced and expanding reciprocity.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To induce
reciprocity
by helping each community define the outcomes the citizens want, the
Vermont
Agency of Human Services is using a tool which will measure the
lifelong
well-being of people in that community. The outcomes hold up a mirror
in
front of each citizen of the community.&nbsp; Examples of community
outcomes
are: children succeeding in school, youth choosing healthy behaviors,
young
people successfully transitioning to adulthood, and families living in
safe and supportive neighborhoods.&nbsp; The outcomes help the people
in
the community see how they look to each other and the world.&nbsp; They
then decide if this is the way they want to look or if they want to
change.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Agency, under Secretary
Jane
Kitchel, has recently instituted a policy that restructures the power
sharing,
resource distribution, and authority ranges between State and
Town.&nbsp;
It is engaging Vermont communities in a conscious process to create the
conditions for communities which allow them to use natural democratic
processes
to address issues of social justice and community well-being. (Ref:
Building
New and Effective Relationships with Vermont Communities, AHS Policy
Cluster
6)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Agency of
Human Services and the Department of Education have collaborated in
collecting
and providing that information to the communities.&nbsp; The
information
has also been made available to the Legislature and the University of
Vermont.&nbsp;
The Community Profiles become the basis for building Regional
Partnerships
between the education and government sectors and the communities in
defining
the outcomes, measuring the progress, and setting outcome goals.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaders in this
partnership
also use information about human nature that shows which epigenetic
rules
are causing problems.&nbsp; A committee of the Vermont Legislature
studied
the early causes of what become societal problems such as stealing and
murder.&nbsp; The causes included inadequate parental guidance of
children.&nbsp;
The committee was provided with information about the rules.&nbsp; An
example
is the "no integrated assessment" rule which was standing in the way of
teaching self-piloting to children and young adults.&nbsp; This insight
provided additional legislative support for the policy change to the
reparative
justice system which has proven to be effective in healing breaches in
reciprocity.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Importantly,
in this partnership women are moving aggressively to use their unique
talents
to make the world better.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">OTHER&nbsp; TOOLS&nbsp;
WHICH&nbsp; WERE&nbsp; HELPFUL&nbsp; IN&nbsp; THIS&nbsp; TEST</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other tools
for
building new partnerships include other evolution-based characteristics
of&nbsp; human behavior and emotions.&nbsp; Fundamental to
understanding
the effect of evolution on all of us is the recognition of the
different
talents of the genders.&nbsp; It is the synergism between women's and
men's
special attributes that gives much of the power to the process of
natural
governance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Women have many exceptional faculties in their
deep evolutionary history: emotional sensitivity, empathy, a broad
contextual
view of any issue, a penchant for long-term planning, a gift for
networking
and negotiating and an impulse to nurture, for example.&nbsp; Men also
have many natural talents that proved to be helpful: a talent for
solving
complex problems, an ability to focus their attention and a gift for
controlling
many of their emotions.&nbsp; (Ref: THE FIRST SEX, Harriet Fisher,
1999.
This reference will be moved to the Notes section of the appendix.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The special
characteristics that women bring to natural democracy were evident in
1987
when Governor Madeleine Kunin set up the Community Control/House Arrest
Advisory Committee to study the feasibility of&nbsp; house arrest and
community
control as alternatives to incarceration.&nbsp; She felt that building
more prisons wasn't really addressing the problem of crime and that
there
needed to be a more fundamental approach.&nbsp; She encouraged the
Department
of Corrections to draft legislation relating to alternatives to
incarceration
which became law in June, 1990.&nbsp; This legislation provided the
opportunity
for the normally adversarial "sides" in the criminal justice process to
tailor a sentence to the criminal and the crime.&nbsp; She realized
that
prisons were overcrowded with offenders&nbsp; who could be effectively
punished by alternatives less costly and more rehabilitative than
incarceration.&nbsp;
Using the life-enhancing epigenetic rules, including the conditions
which
encourage reciprocity as guides, the legislation was designed to permit
more direct community involvement in making offenders accountable,
getting
offenders to contract to acknowledge their crimes, repair damage,
return
value to the community, take responsibility for personal change, and
provide
restitution to victims.&nbsp; The legislation called for
community-based
rehabilitation programs for offenders who do not pose a substantial
risk
of harm to the public.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Dr.
Howard
Dean became Governor of Vermont, his reputation as a caring leader
moved
him swiftly to the chair of the National Governors' Association in
1995.&nbsp;
He made Families and Social Justice the theme of the year's
work.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He focused attention on the question, "What helps children develop into
caring, competent adults and what blocks them?"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The governors
worked for the year to identify factors preventing children's
development
and what to do about it.&nbsp; When the governors came to Burlington,
Vermont,
for their annual meeting, they had a vision of what the attainment of
these
goals would look like: cohesive families that are dependable under
stress,
with at least one adult who is consistently nurturing and loving,
living
in a supportive and caring community which has a&nbsp; sense of hope
for
a bright future.&nbsp; The governors recognized that these goals were
based
on the fundamental component in human nature that motivates parents to
take care of their children.&nbsp; They acknowledged women's unique
qualities
in the partnership between mothers and fathers.&nbsp; Louree Holly, a
Wisconsin
mother who was invited to give testimony, said, "We mothers do know how
to discipline our kids.&nbsp; We focus them on working hard to get high
grades.&nbsp; We love them for that as only a mother can."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They identified
persistent
roadblocks that stood in the way of achieving their vision: our
youngest
citizens are suffering the most (child abuse, domestic violence);
economic
and social conditions are making parenting difficult; women's special,
natural attributes to nurture are being smothered by these conditions;
and parents have abandoned their responsibilities.&nbsp; Highly
fragmented
and crisis-oriented governments make the individual and family failures
worse. Large bureaucracies and distant policy makers have supplanted
local
decisions about ways to help children.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During
that year, Vermont's Secretary of Human Services, Cornelius ("Con")
Hogan,
had helped Governor Dean and several other governors to prepare for the
annual meeting.&nbsp; Con and his people had developed several programs
that were removing the roadblocks to achieve the vision.&nbsp; The
governors
meeting provided the opportunity for Vermont to present the results of
those programs.
&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHY&nbsp; VERMONT&nbsp; WAS&nbsp;
ABLE&nbsp; TO&nbsp; HELP&nbsp; OTHER&nbsp; STATES&nbsp; TAKE&nbsp;
HUMAN&nbsp; NATURE&nbsp; INTO&nbsp; ACCOUNT
</span><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had
worked with Con and his staff in taking human nature into
account.&nbsp;
We had already taken the step of understanding the problems the
governors
were articulating in human nature terms. A question we used to focus
our
understanding was, "How was automatic control of our genes creating the
obstacles to families and communities that the governors later
identified?&nbsp;
Answering that question in Vermont had told us how to move into a
precise
steering mode for solving problems by natural governance.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were
mindful
of the list of human nature's tendencies, especially those unique to
women.&nbsp;
Included were the tendencies described in Chapter 2 and in the
Appendix:
reciprocity, no integrated assessment, two-part classification, anxiety
in the presence of strangers, and special nurturing by women.&nbsp; We
then looked at each obstacle to see which tendencies were in control as
contributing causes.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the common trap was often
the tendency not to make integrated assessments.&nbsp; Parents,
especially
men, were not realizing how much divorce was causing children to
suffer.&nbsp;
I listened as a divorced prison inmate described to a legislative
committee
how he felt about not taking responsibility for his children.&nbsp; He
felt no guilt or unfulfilled obligation about having left his family.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public
was
unaware that simply requiring child support money diminishes
opportunities
for reciprocity.&nbsp; People paid their taxes to support welfare, but
failed to understand that this expenditure was no substitute for the
reciprocity
that would make many welfare payments unnecessary.&nbsp; Lack of
reciprocity
was perpetuating the need for higher taxes to support welfare.&nbsp; On
the other side of the equation, a typical welfare mother, overburdened
and harassed by single-parent family obligations, does not have time to
do more than struggle on while resenting the lack of sharing in family
tasks on the part of the father of her children.&nbsp; She certainly
did
not have the information she would have needed to make an integrated
assessment
of all the breaches in reciprocity that had led to her resentment.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if
taxpayers
and welfare mothers together were to evaluate their real obligations to
each other and the consequences of not meeting them?&nbsp; Who else
should
be present if they were to do that?&nbsp; Is there anything in
Vermont's
experience with the reparative board system that would give a clue to a
way to bring about that evaluation of obligations?&nbsp; We've seen
that
taxpayers on the reparative boards help the offenders and the victims
make
integrated assessments.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As Con and we continued to think about the underlying human nature
causes
for the obstacles, we noticed conditions, tendencies, and emotions
which
helped us to understand, in a more fundamental way, what was really
going
on.&nbsp; Many taxpayers had a us/them attitude toward welfare.&nbsp;
Here
was the two-part classification tendency at work: "We work hard to take
care of our children. They should take care of themselves and their
families."&nbsp;
A feature necessary for the reciprocity tendency to function was
lacking.
Taxpayers were not experiencing any return on their investment, and
felt
they were giving more than they were getting back. Reciprocity requires
the opposite situation in order for it to be a life-enhancing, ongoing
tendency.&nbsp;&nbsp; We asked ourselves this question: how could the
system
be designed to meet that requirement?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also
noticed
the human tendency to obey arbitrary authority, specifically the
"authority"
of the bureaucratic welfare system.&nbsp; The system had become a
despot,
and blind obedience to it was undermining personal responsibility for
preventing
the conditions that made welfare necessary.&nbsp; These conditions
included
the husband leaving the marriage without taking full responsibility for
adequate support of the family he left behind, and then being charged
with
child support without being allowed to participate in the family.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We looked at
the impact of this and other related tendencies.&nbsp; Men have an
innate
desire to participate in full partnership with their mate in raising a
young child -- survival of their genes.&nbsp; This tendency is at odds
with the strong, unconscious desire to increase their reproductive
success
by mating with other women.&nbsp; In modern societies, this second
tendency
is apt to win out in cases where men do not stay with their original
mate
during the child raising, or they leave a few years after the first
child
is born.&nbsp; The pattern of divorce in several countries, including
the
United States, shows this second tendency controlling in many
marriages.&nbsp;
Women, for different reasons, but still tied to reproductive success,
also
have inherited an unconscious natural tendency to be somewhat
adventurous
in seeking out other mates, unless inhibited sufficiently by the bounds
of culture.&nbsp;&nbsp; We found that these male and female tendencies
appeared to be upsetting the balance of reciprocity in marriage, and
obviously
they were having a negative effect on the lives of many children.&nbsp;
The imbalance of reciprocity was probably contributing&nbsp; to
emotional
maltreatment of children, to impaired psychological growth; to sexual
abuse,
molestation, exploitation and to neglect and abandonment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
All
are breaches in reciprocity.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These
insights
about human nature gave us clues about how to reform the welfare
system.&nbsp;
The new Secretary of Human Services, Jane B. Kitchel, worked with Con
and
understands the reasons for the adverse consequences of automatic
control
by the genes. Jane and her colleagues are moving rapidly to redesign
systems
to help repair the breaches in reciprocity.&nbsp; Conditions that
induce
reciprocity are being designed into the delivery of human services:
home
visits to parents with children from birth to school age, childbirth
preparation
classes, and education in parenting, for example.&nbsp; Volunteers, as
well as Agency of Human Services staff, are involved in these
activities.&nbsp;
The goal is to foster a&nbsp; positive relationship between family,
school,
and community and encourage nurturing and responsibility from the
beginning
of parenthood..&nbsp; Through involvement of the whole community,
including
business people, reciprocity is becoming visible and increasing.&nbsp;
It is also showing up as volunteers provide respite care so welfare
mothers
can acquire the skills for self-sufficiency, and help to remove
barriers
and disincentives that discourage them from working.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The healing
of
breaches in reciprocity and removal of barriers to work is resulting in
cost savings.&nbsp; First under Con's leadership, then under Jane's,
Vermont's
total welfare budget has been reduced 19 percent in four years, from
$65
million to $54 million.&nbsp; Child-support collection is up nearly 200
percent, resulting in over $90 million of additional support for
children
and families since 1990.&nbsp; A 30-percent decrease in pregnancies for
young women aged 15-17 has resulted in a saving of $5 million over the
past six years.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">ADDRESSING&nbsp; FUNDAMENTAL&nbsp;
CAUSES&nbsp; OF&nbsp; HUMAN SERVICES
PROBLEMS
</span><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The successes
of the reparative justice system encouraged the Vermont legislature to
think about its application in other agencies of state
government.&nbsp;
It appointed a&nbsp; Joint Committee on Design of Future Corrections
Policy.&nbsp;
The membership on this committee consisted of the chairs of major
standing
committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives.&nbsp;
Working
together over three years, they came to realize that corrections policy
was intimately involved with welfare policy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee
visited all of the state prisons and interviewed several inmates about
their life history that had led to their incarceration.&nbsp; Most
stories
disclosed several breaches in reciprocity in the early years. Child
abuse,
neglect, desertion by fathers and parental alcoholism were present.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These
interviews
helped the committee to take a longer view of corrections policy.&nbsp;
The members were ready to support Con Hogan when he proposed a lifetime
perspective for the entire Human Services Agency. During&nbsp; the
period,
Con set up the system for providing each community with measures of
outcomes
related to the lifelong well being of people in that community.&nbsp;
In
addition to the ones already mentioned, examples include providing
statistics
about newborns and young thriving children, children well prepared to
attend
school, and children living in stable families.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary
Hogan
collaborated with the then Commissioner of Education Mark Hull in
helping
communities compile this information.&nbsp;&nbsp; They also made the
data
available to the legislature and to the University of Vermont.&nbsp; It
became the basis for a partnership among the education and government
sectors
and the communities for use in solving societal problems and in making
progress in improving quality of life.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
partnership
resulted in such quality of life changes as a doubling of&nbsp;
parent-community
leadership training, early prenatal care well above the national
average,&nbsp;
a doubling of child care programs, increases in scholastic achievement
test scores, a drop in young teen age pregnancy rates, reductions in
child
abuse and neglect, more parents talking with children about school,
more
of the elderly and people with disabilities living with dignity and
independence
in settings they prefer, and significant growth of the successful
reparative
program in the criminal justice system.&nbsp; There have been positive
trends in establishing paternities, and consequent collection of child
support from absent parents.&nbsp; Immunizations of young children are
up.&nbsp; The number and percentages of low income children eating good
breakfasts at school are up.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My role in
the
above was to provide information about human nature as a guide to the
decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I&nbsp; identified which epigenetic rules were controlling the
problems,
and which policy changes would be likely to induce the most effective
reciprocity.&nbsp;
The outcome data gave each community visibility on the breaches in
reciprocity
that were causing the problems.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Led by
Con, his deputy Cheryl Mitchell, and Jane Kitchel, who at that time was
commissioner of social welfare, the Agency increased the use of the
life-enhancing
tendencies.&nbsp; Integrated assessment is helping communities find and
implement more opportunities for reciprocity.&nbsp; Two-part
classification
is being reduced as people recognize their shared interests.&nbsp;
Deception
is being lessened by the openness of&nbsp; the activities.&nbsp; Their
fundamental strategy is based on their understanding of these
tendencies
which will help people move from automatic control by these tendencies
to conscious control of the ways these and other tendencies are
influencing
their lives.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
bureaucratic
welfare system is being replaced by real people, neighbors in the
community.&nbsp;
The City of Barre is an example of the value of using this information
about human nature. Con and his colleagues provided the city council,
the
mayor, and elected school officials with information on breaches in
reciprocity:
the teen pregnancy rate and substance abuse rates were high, as was
physical
abuse in families.&nbsp; This was information that thoughtful people in
Barre could not ignore.&nbsp; As a result, the community has addressed
its fundamental values: Who are we?&nbsp; What do we believe in?&nbsp;
What is important to us?&nbsp; How can we make our values real and live
them in a way such that our children will&nbsp; imitate us?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mayor and
the entire community questioned why their young people had need to numb
their minds with drugs. Energized by this questioning the voters in
Barre
passed a bond to increase the&nbsp; size of the city's library.&nbsp;
The
voters have initiated a program on Lifelong Learning and Literacy with
the objective of developing positive relationships among family, school
and community from the beginning of parenthood.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">STILL&nbsp; A&nbsp; LONG&nbsp; WAY&nbsp;
TO&nbsp; GO
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My colleagues
in the Agency of Human Services and I combined the insights from the
Lexington
test with what we'd learned from involving the public in governance in
Vermont.&nbsp; The combination seemed to tell us we should try to
further
broaden public participation in addressing social problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The reparative boards are a step in that direction by creating a more
direct
link between state government and the decision-making process.&nbsp;
But
what still seems to be lacking is using this information by communities
in their town meetings.&nbsp; In the Lexington test, we had that link.
We not only had a broad range of local and regional public issues on
the
agenda, but we had at least one national issue -- public policy on
funding
for research to extend the healthy middle years of life.&nbsp; In
Vermont
at present, the local town meeting decision-making is generally limited
to such local items as school budgets, road repair, and waste disposal.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What might
happen
if Vermont learned what the Lexington test had demonstrated by bringing
regional, state, national, and global issues into its town
meetings?&nbsp;
Suppose, for example, that town meetings took on some of the policy
issues
in the welfare system.&nbsp;&nbsp; How many of the breaches in
reciprocity
that we've identified in that system could be productively addressed on
the local decision-making agendas?&nbsp; How about the breach that the
governors addressed: large bureaucracies and distant policy makers have
supplanted local decision-making?&nbsp; Who isn't being included in the
decision chain?&nbsp; Who should be in the decision chain?&nbsp; What
reciprocities
are being breached because they are not presently included?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
reciprocity-inducing
features in both the Lexington test and the Vermont initiative.&nbsp;
Putting
the two together gives clues to help develop a vision of natural
democracy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed
likely
to me that progress toward that vision would be limited until human
nature
is more consciously taken into account by everybody, not just the
leaders,
not just leaders like Con Hogan, Jane Kitchel, John Gorczyk, and others
like them.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE&nbsp; FEASIBILITY&nbsp; OF&nbsp;
NATURAL&nbsp; DEMOCRACY
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we combine
the results of the three tests, the results could stand democracy on
<br>
its head.&nbsp; (As a reminder, we've used the understanding of our
genes to reduce crime, to guide the development of technology for use
in
education, and to guide community governance.) If people at the
community
level were to take human nature into account, they would become the
core
of democracy just as Lexingtonians did.&nbsp; The act of switching from
unconscious control by the epigenetic rules and the genes to conscious
control of the epigenetic rules and the genes is the basic
transformation
needed to make natural democracy effective at every level of
governance.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The core
components
of natural democracy at the community level are listed below:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Participants educated in understanding
human nature&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Total community involved in
face to face dialogue&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Comprehensive agenda including
longer range goals&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Required information instantly
available&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Links with state, national,
and global governances <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last
item,
linkages, will have the most effect in revolutionizing democracy.&nbsp;
But these linkages will be feasible and effective only to the extent
that
all core components necessary for reciprocity are present. For example,
participants at the local level who have links with state, national,
and
global governances are more likely to understand the advantages and
feasibility
of making progress toward great goals.&nbsp; It will work the other way
as well.&nbsp; Great goals will inspire developing and sustaining the
community's
links with state, national, and global governances.</p>

NATURAL&nbsp; GOVERNANCE</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Con Hogan and
his people had initiated ways of developing these links well before the
National Governors' Association 1985 annual meeting.&nbsp; Twelve
regional
partnerships have evolved from those links.&nbsp; The largest one is
called
the Champlain Initiative, named after the lake which forms the Western
boader of the region. 0&nbsp; Burlington, Vermont's most populous city
and a large IBM plant are located in the region.&nbsp; More than three
hundred individuals from all backgrounds have collaborated to create a
vision of what this partnership could become over the next two decades.
Participants in the Initiative include private citizens, businesses,
government,
and non-profit organizations.&nbsp; Together they have constructed a
plan
for investment of human and financial resources to assure the physical,
economic, social, cultural and environmental viability of the
region.&nbsp;
Their goals are "building self-worth, pride, self-esteem in individuals
and communities; opening for the community a broader range of choices
in
their lives, along with the freedom and security to make those choices;
encouraging personal growth and ensuring the opportunity for each
person
to reach his or her potential; fostering personal responsibility to
care
for the larger community beyond their individual lives."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane
Kitchel's
Agency of Human Services provides the statewide coordination of these
regional
partnerships.&nbsp; (Ref: The Social Well-Being of Vermonters, February
2001. This reference will be inserted in the Notes section of the
Appendix.)&nbsp;
The conditions that induce reciprocity have been built into the
regional
governance processes.&nbsp; For example, the people in the Champlain
Initiative
say they are committed to honesty and trust which is insurance against
cheating that would destroy reciprocity.&nbsp; Close proximity
and&nbsp;
frequent opportunities for exchange of favors are built in by their
commitment
to "come together for the long term,"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The regional
partnerships are provided with measurements of how well they are doing
in improving the well-being of Vermont's people.&nbsp; In 1994 the
partners
agreed to move toward an outcomes-based approach.&nbsp; Measurements of
progress in improving well-being include: how well families, youth, and
individuals are engaged in their community's decisions and activities;
how well children are prepared to start school; how well children
succeed
in school; children living in stable and supported families; youth
choosing
healthy behaviors; youth successfully transitioning to adulthood;
elders
and people with disabilities live with dignity and independence; and
families
living in safe and supportive communities.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The record
shows
many heartening signs: continuing success in giving a healthy start to
infants and young children, growing economic resources for many
families,
decline in teen age pregnancies, progress in discouraging the fatal mix
of driving and alcohol.&nbsp; Trouble spots are evident, too. For
example,
wages for many Vermonters are inadequate to meet basic needs.&nbsp;
Jane
Kitchel's February 2001 report optmistically summarizes progress:
"Vermonters
have much to feel proud of -- and, we can do better!".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose that
people throughout the United States and the world were to learn how to
take human nature into account.&nbsp; John Gorczyk is spreading the
word.&nbsp;&nbsp;
His is not a cry for reform based on any philosophical or ideological
biases.&nbsp;
He is promoting instead an integration of the understanding of human
nature
with government, management, economics, and the marketplace. Gorczyk is
changing his organization from being the Department of Corrections to
becoming
the "Department of Cooperation".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communities
are
learning to think of dealing with crime as an opportunity to teach
young
people the personal advantages of expanding reciprocity and natural
democracy.&nbsp;
The DOC has catalyzed the formation of Justice Centers which put this
teaching
into practice. Community leaders from all walks of life are cooperating
to bring the full strength of their communities to the task of
catalyzing
natural democracy.&nbsp; As the participants become better informed
about
natural democracy and human nature, their chances for sustained success
will be substantially enhanced.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose,
then,
that people around the country get excited about how they can take
human
nature into account. Suppose they develop ways of building into their
own
governance systems all of the conditions that encourage reciprocity.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose they
find ways of using technology to help create those systems.&nbsp;
Industry
has an opportunity here.&nbsp; You've seen the Polaroid example where
we
developed ways of using instant photography to both teach reciprocity
and
encourage its spread in schools and neighborhoods.&nbsp; Our schools
can
prepare caring teachers and sharing students to be&nbsp; bridges to
their
homes and communities, and prepare young people for governance by human
nature and for subsequent participation in natural democracy.&nbsp; We
can export the caring from the classrooms into the communities,
creating
oases of love.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next logical
step for Vermont, and other states as well, is to try out the Lexington
model of expanded town meeting, with its policy-development connections
to state and federal levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More discussions of
desired
outcomes should find their way into local meetings.&nbsp; Opportunities
for healing breaches in reciprocity will become increasingly visible.
Costs
and benefits will be calculated.&nbsp; The benefits will be shown to
outweigh
the costs, as is generally the case in reciprocal exchanges.&nbsp;
Responsibility
for achieving the benefits will be accepted as it was in
Lexington.&nbsp;
Pride in successful outcomes will be shared.&nbsp; If we allow it,
natural
governance will become ongoing as surely as our human nature is
ongoing.&nbsp;
We will have successfully designed our governance to build in the
opportunities
to do what, by our nature, we want to do to our mutual advantage.&nbsp;
Notice how significant the epigenetic rules will be; every behavior in
this natural governance process will be guided by them.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
will be in control of that guidance process by being conscious of the
rules
and the influence of our genes at every step.&nbsp; They will give us
the
power to predict which policy options will produce the most rapid
expansion
of reciprocity and remove the remaining obstacles.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We in Vermont
have shown how natural democracy is being put to work in areas of
governance
beyond crime reduction.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've shown
how technology can be applied to help create the conditions that induce
reciprocity and make natural governance feasible.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've gauged
the effectiveness of the tools&nbsp; of natural governance in the
larger
scope of natural democracy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've encouraged
citizens to be politically engaged in helping their government improve
its performance, as Derek Bok strongly advocates.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've refuted
the belief that one can be ignorant of how the mind works, and still
participate
fully and effectively in the democratic process.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has become
obvious to us that taking human nature into account allows us to gain
the
advantages of natural democracy.&nbsp; We need a more full
understanding
of our evolutionary past to see where we'll want to go in the future
and
how to get there.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We described
these tests with three goals in mind: to discover ways of moving
humanity
from its childhood to its adulthood; taking over control of our lives
from
the unconscious influence of the epigenetic rules and the genes; and
creating
the conditions in our lives that induce reciprocity.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've defined
a governance process by which all three of these goals can be met.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose
people all over the United States take advantage of ways to form a
continuous
chain of reciprocal relationships, starting at the family level and
continuing
through to the community, state, national, and international
levels.&nbsp;
Democracy will become the collective venture that Derek Bok
envisions.1&nbsp;
Together we will have created governance that fully and consciously
takes
human nature into account, -- natural democracy.
