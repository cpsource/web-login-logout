<p style='margin:0in'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:#0E101A'>William's
father died when he was five, and his mother raised him and his younger sister
Natalie in Belmont, MA. He graduated from Belmont High School. At graduation,
they lined up by height. Standing next to him in line was a tall beauty named
Janet, who became his wife of sixty-odd years. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:#0E101A'>Bill Page
earned a work scholarship to study engineering at Tufts. As part of his Navy
training, he studied at Harvard and then served in the Pacific, returning as a
different person committed to world peace. &nbsp;Bill received a master's in
engineering from MIT and worked at the Brookhaven Nuclear research facility on
Long Island. &nbsp;But his vision of the future was different from theirs, and
he moved back to Boston, working first at Grace Chemical, where he hired Itzak
Bentov, a brilliant Israeli scientist and inventor, and Roko Yasui, who became
a close friend.&nbsp; When Edwin Land formed Polaroid Corporation in 1950, Bill
joined and eventually became Director of Corporate Planning.&nbsp; He guided
the creation of their popular instant cameras and worked to get them introduced
into education. As just one example of his work there, he taught city children
to use the cameras to visualize their conception of peace and the dream of
Martin Luther King, Jr. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:#0E101A'>Bill founded
Tree Growers, Inc., a timber company, in the 1960s with his good friend Brownie
Parker. On one level, the company maintained forests and sold timber. Its
primary purpose was to preserve thousands of acres of pristine woodlands,
which, thanks to Bill and his colleagues, are enjoyed by outdoors people today.
Bill volunteered with Boy Scouts, who met at 1st Parish, guiding his sons
through the program, including Eagle Scout Charlie Page.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:#0E101A'>Bill was an
active town meeting member in Lexington for over thirty years, founding the
Committee on Aging and serving on many other committees.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:#0E101A'>After
retiring from Polaroid, Bill and Janet Page retired to Westmore, VT.&nbsp;
Janet's family had been there since 1907.&nbsp; But he was not content hiking
the beautiful mountains and swimming in Lake Willoughby - although he loved
these things very much.&nbsp; Bill's voracious mind and yearning to change the
world led him to volunteer his services to benefit all Vermonters. A student of
E. O. Wilson and the study of evolutionary psychology, Bill convinced Joe
Patrissi and John Perry of the Vermont State Corrections Department to learn
more about human nature. This study led to the creation of a <strong>Restorative
Justice</strong> System, the first of its kind in the United States.&nbsp;Based
on a human behavioral trait called &quot;reciprocal altruism,&quot; good things
happen in return when we do good things.&nbsp; Vermont colleague John Perry
writes:</span></p>

<p style='margin:1em'><span style='font-style: italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:18.0pt;color:#0E101A'>&quot;The
result (of working with Bill Page over 15 years) was the development of the
Vermont Reparative Probation program, where panels of ordinary citizens meet
with victims and offenders involved with less severe crime and work out a
contract for the offender to make amends to the victim, and to assure
completion of the agreement.&nbsp;Since 1995, the program has involved more
than a thousand Vermont citizens as panel members and more than 16,000
offenders.&nbsp; A vast study involving some 25,000 offenders by Gale Burford
at the University of Vermont and Jack Humphrey at the University of New
Hampshire found that offenders who participated in Reparative Probation were
23% less likely to recidivate than those treated in ordinary correctional
programs.&quot;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in'><span style='font-size:18.0pt;color:#0E101A'>The program
went on to win a Ford Foundation <em><b>Innovations in American Government</b> </em>award,
be recognized by the National Institute of Justice, and catch on like wildfire
nationwide. Restorative Justice programs are in operation across all 50 states,
all provinces in Canada, and nations around the world.</span></p>
