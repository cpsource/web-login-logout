Joy, beautiful spark of Divinity [or: of gods],<br>
Daughter of Elysium,<br>
We enter, drunk with fire,<br>
Heavenly one, thy sanctuary!<br>
Thy magic binds again<br>
What custom strictly divided;*<br>
All people become brothers,*<br>
Where thy gentle wing abides.<br>
<br>
Whoever has succeeded in the great attempt,<br>
To be a friend's friend,<br>
Whoever has won a lovely woman,<br>
Add his to the jubilation!<br>
Yes, and also whoever has just one soul<br>
To call his own in this world!<br>
And he who never managed it should slink<br>
Weeping from this union!<br>
<br>
All creatures drink of joy<br>
At nature's breasts.<br>
All the Just, all the Evil<br>
Follow her trail of roses.<br>
Kisses she gave us and grapevines,<br>
A friend, proven in death.<br>
Ecstasy was given to the worm<br>
And the cherub stands before God.<br>
<br>
Gladly, as His suns fly through the heavens' grand plan<br>
Go on, brothers, your way,<br>
Joyful, like a hero to victory.<br>
<br>
Be embraced, Millions!<br>
This kiss to all the world!<br>
Brothers, above the starry canopy<br>
There must dwell a loving Father.<br>
Are you collapsing, millions?<br>
Do you sense the creator, world?<br>
Seek him above the starry canopy!<br>
Above stars must He dwell.<br>
</p>
