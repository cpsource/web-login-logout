In CSS, selectors are used to select and style HTML elements. The use of a dot (.) before a name in CSS is specifically for class selectors. Here's a breakdown of the different types of CSS selectors, including those that begin with a dot.

### Class Selectors

**Class selectors** are used to select elements that have a specific class attribute. The class name is prefixed with a dot (.) in the CSS.

#### Example

HTML:
```html
<div class="example">This is a div with a class.</div>
<p class="example">This is a paragraph with the same class.</p>
```

CSS:
```css
.example {
  color: blue;
}
```

In this example, any element with the class `example` will have blue text. Both the `<div>` and `<p>` elements will be affected by this CSS rule because they both have the class `example`.

### Other Types of Selectors

1. **Element Selectors**:
   - Selects all elements of a given type.
   - Example: `p { color: red; }` selects all `<p>` elements and sets their text color to red.

2. **ID Selectors**:
   - Selects a single element with a specific ID.
   - The ID name is prefixed with a hash (#) in the CSS.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <div id="unique">This div has a unique ID.</div>
     ```
     ```css
     #unique {
       color: green;
     }
     ```

3. **Attribute Selectors**:
   - Selects elements based on an attribute or attribute value.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
     <input type="password" placeholder="Enter your password">
     ```
     ```css
     input[type="text"] {
       border: 1px solid blue;
     }
     ```

4. **Pseudo-class Selectors**:
   - Selects elements based on their state.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <a href="#">This is a link</a>
     ```
     ```css
     a:hover {
       color: red;
     }
     ```

5. **Pseudo-element Selectors**:
   - Selects and styles parts of an element.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
     ```
     ```css
     p::first-line {
       font-weight: bold;
     }
     ```

### Combining Selectors

Selectors can also be combined to create more specific rules.

#### Example

HTML:
```html
<div class="container">
  <p class="text">This is inside a container.</p>
  <p>This is also inside a container.</p>
</div>
<p class="text">This is outside the container.</p>
```

CSS:
```css
.container .text {
  color: purple;
}
```

In this example, only the `<p class="text">` inside the `<div class="container">` will have purple text.

### Summary

- **Class selectors (.)**: Target elements with a specific class attribute.
- **Element selectors**: Target elements of a specific type.
- **ID selectors (#)**: Target a single element with a specific ID.
- **Attribute selectors**: Target elements based on attributes.
- **Pseudo-class selectors**: Target elements based on their state (e.g., `:hover`).
- **Pseudo-element selectors**: Target parts of an element (e.g., `::first-line`).

Using these selectors appropriately allows for precise and effective styling of HTML elements on a web page.
