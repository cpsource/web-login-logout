## Determine Web Site Font
The font used in the headline "The U.S. is trying to stop China from getting Nvidia microchips to advance its military. The private sector is fighting back. 11 min read" would depend on the specific website or publication displaying the headline. Different publications use different fonts based on their design guidelines. However, here are some common fonts used by major news websites and publications:

  * The New York Times: Georgia (serif) for body text and Cheltenham (serif) for headlines.
  * The Washington Post: Postoni (serif) for headlines and San Francisco (sans-serif) for body text.
  * BBC: BBC Reith (sans-serif).
  * CNN: CNN uses a custom font family called "CNN Sans" (sans-serif).
  * The Guardian: Guardian Egyptian Web (serif) for headlines and Guardian Text Sans for body text.
  * Time: Helvetica Neue (sans-serif) or Georgia (serif).

## Examine CSS
To accurately determine the font, you would need to inspect the specific website's CSS where the headline is located. Here is how you can do it:

Open the Webpage: Navigate to the webpage with the headline.
Inspect the Element: Right-click on the headline and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the context menu.
Check the CSS: In the developer tools, look at the styles applied to the headline element. You will see the font-family listed in the CSS rules.
This method will provide you with the exact font used for the headline on that particular website. If you provide me with the specific publication or website, I can give a more targeted answer based on their known font usage.

## A Trick to build a static web page

If you do:

  * `php fonts.php > fonts.html`

you will get a static web page, called fonts.html
