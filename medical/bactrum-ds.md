No, Bactrim-DS is not a cephalosporin. Bactrim-DS (double strength) is a combination antibiotic that contains two active ingredients: **sulfamethoxazole** and **trimethoprim**. These two drugs work together to inhibit the growth of bacteria by blocking different steps in the bacterial folic acid synthesis pathway.

Cephalosporins, on the other hand, are a different class of antibiotics that work by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis. Examples of cephalosporins include cefalexin, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxone.

So, Bactrim-DS belongs to the class of antibiotics known as **sulfonamides**, not cephalosporins.
