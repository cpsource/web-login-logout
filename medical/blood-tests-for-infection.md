Blood tests that can indicate the presence of an infection include:

### 1. **White Blood Cell (WBC) Count:**
   - **Leukocytosis:** An elevated WBC count is often a sign of infection. The body increases the production of WBCs to fight off the infection.
   - **Differential WBC Count:** This test provides a breakdown of the different types of white blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. An increase in specific types of WBCs can provide clues about the type of infection (e.g., bacterial vs. viral).

### 2. **C-Reactive Protein (CRP):**
   - CRP is a protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Elevated levels of CRP can indicate an acute infection or inflammation.

### 3. **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):**
   - ESR measures how quickly red blood cells settle at the bottom of a test tube. An elevated ESR can indicate inflammation or infection in the body.

### 4. **Procalcitonin:**
   - Procalcitonin is a marker that is often elevated in bacterial infections and sepsis. It is used particularly in diagnosing and monitoring severe bacterial infections.

### 5. **Blood Cultures:**
   - Blood cultures are used to detect bacteria or fungi in the blood. This test is especially important for diagnosing systemic infections, such as sepsis.

### 6. **Lactate:**
   - Elevated lactate levels in the blood can indicate sepsis or severe infection, particularly when tissue oxygenation is compromised.

### 7. **Serum Amyloid A (SAA):**
   - SAA is an acute-phase protein that, like CRP, increases in response to inflammation and infection.

### 8. **Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR):**
   - The ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes can be an indicator of infection, particularly bacterial infections, where neutrophil counts tend to rise.

### 9. **Platelet Count:**
   - Though not specific to infection, changes in platelet count can occur in the context of an infection. Thrombocytosis (high platelet count) can occur in response to infection, while thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) might be seen in severe infections or sepsis.

### 10. **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
   - While the WBC count is part of a CBC, the full CBC can provide additional information, such as the presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia, which can be relevant in the context of certain infections.

These tests, often used in combination, help healthcare providers diagnose infections and monitor the effectiveness of treatment.
